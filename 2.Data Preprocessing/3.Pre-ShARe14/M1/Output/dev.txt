Right lower extremity demonstrated a displaced right femoral fracture , nondisplaced fracture of the proximal right fibula .
5,5,8,8 Disorder|10,11 Disorder

HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was stabilized in the trauma bay , remained hemodynamically stable and after uncovering the extensive orthopedic injuries , she was taken to the Operating Room by the Orthopedic 's Team .
20,21 Disorder

At this time , the patient was also noted to have a significant perineal injury and the
13,14 Disorder

General Surgery and Colorectal Surgery teams were involved .


At that initial operating room intervention , the patient underwent multiple procedures which included incision and drainage of the right forearm , external fixation of the right forearm fractures , and IM rodding of the right femur .
27,28 Disorder

A perineal debridement followed by rectal washout and a diverting end - colostomy .


The patient tolerated all of these procedure well , remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the Trauma


Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring , ventilatory support and continued workup for injuries .
13,13 Disorder

The patient 's ensuing hospital course was significant for multiple trips to the Operating Room for debridement of her right thigh and buttock region .


There were multiple swab cultures taken and the patient was placed on the appropriate antibiotics .


She tolerated all of these procedures well and to facilitate the multiple trips to the Operating Room , the patient required ventilatory support and remained intubated during this period of time .


For sedation , she remained on narcotic and benzodiazepine drips which maintained her appropriate sedation levels .


On [ * * 2016 - 08 - 16** ] , while undergoing the debridement of the right buttock and thigh wound , underwent an ultrasound of the rectum which demonstrated an intact sphincter .
18,18,21,21 Disorder|20,21 Disorder

She also was noted at this time to have right purulent drainage from the right forearm where the external fixator had been placed and this was opened and debrided .
10,11 Disorder

Approximately a week after the initial injury and multiple debridements , Plastic Surgery was involved and after careful consideration it was considered for a VAC drain placement to allow the bed of tissue to granulate and look towards wound closure at some future point .
6,6 Disorder|38,38 Disorder

This was placed and she was continued on appropriate antibiotics .


Her nutrition was addressed with TPN initially and she was converted to tube feeds which she has tolerated .


Infectious Disease consultation was obtained .


Due to the extensive debridement of the right thigh and buttock region which was essentially down to the bone , the patient was diagnosed with osteomyelitis and she was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics which will be continued for an extensive period of time beyond this admission .
25,25 Disorder

Beginning on [ * * 2016 - 08 - 19** ] , the patient began to have temperature spikes and she was pan cultured .
17,18 Disorder

She was maintained on her broad spectrum antibiotics .


On [ * * 2016 - 08 - 24** ] , she was taken back to the Operating Room by the


Orthopedics Team where her right femur rod was removed and she had a replacement IM rod placed .


She had an echocardiogram which did not demonstrate any vegetations .
9,9 Disorder

After that orthopedic procedure , the patient actually defervesced . She was maintained on her antibiotic course .
8,8 Disorder

The VAC drains have been periodically changed every three to five days .


In early August , the patient was weaned to extubation which she has tolerated .


She was weaned off of her sedation which had resulted actually in high levels of narcotic and benzodiazepines .


In order to combat withdrawal , she was placed on an around the clock dose of Ativan to combat any tremulousness or withdrawal symptoms .
4,4 Disorder|20,20 Disorder|22,23 Disorder

J - tube Placement


History of Present Illness :


This 55 - year - old lady has a history of chronic alcoholic - induced pancreatitis .
11,15 Disorder

She has had a pseudocyst problem in the past that resolved over time and has previously had an open J tube placement in the last year for malnutrition during this period .
4,4 Disorder|27,27 Disorder

She recently presented with overt jaundice from bile duct obstruction and a history of many weeks of decline .
5,5 Disorder|7,9 Disorder

She has only lost 4 pounds over this period of time , but has been malnourished and unable to eat regular foods and has sustained herself only on liquids because of gastric outlet obstruction .
15,15 Disorder|31,33 Disorder

She was transferred to our care for assessment of her biliary obstruction and thoughts of therapeutic approaches to this and the large pseudocyst that was identified that was on the order of 10 x 10 cm in her mid - abdomen .
10,11 Disorder|22,22 Disorder

When we assessed her CAT scan , it was clear that she had three problems .


1 . Biliary obstruction from an obstructed bile duct .
2,3 Disorder|6,8 Disorder

2 . Gastric outlet obstruction from the duodenum being splayed across this large pseudocyst in the head of the pancreas .
2,4 Disorder|13,13 Disorder

3 . Sinistral hypertension from her pseudocyst as well .
2,3 Disorder|6,6 Disorder

It was clear that the whole upper abdomen was full of massive venous collaterals in that in fact the superior mesenteric vein drained into the splenic vein in order to drain her bowels .
12,13 Disorder

The interface between the lower aspect of the portal vein and the superior mesenteric vein was completely splayed out and attenuated and probably thrombosed by the pseudocyst mass effect .
23,23 Disorder|26,26 Disorder

With Dr . [ * * First Name ( STitle ) * * ] [ * * Name ( STitle ) 1453** ] , we decided that there was no value in any endoscopic approaches to either the pseudocyst or the biliary obstruction and it was clear that an operative approach was the safest and only way to approach this .
