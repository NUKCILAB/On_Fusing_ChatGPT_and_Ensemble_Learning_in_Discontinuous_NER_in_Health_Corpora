It was their recommendation to continue beta - blocker , as much as her rate and blood pressure would tolerate , as well as to continue the Amiodarone .


It was also their recommendation to check TSH , as well as to anticoagulate her .


An intravenous Heparin drip was started at that time , and she has been transitioned to oral Coumadin dosing for anticoagulation for postoperative atrial fibrillation .
23,24 Disorder

Of note , the patient 's TSH at that time was 13 . She had an


Endocrinology consult the following day , and it was their recommendation not to replace any thyroid hormone at that time , yet their recommendation was to follow - up with her primary care physician [ * * Initials ( NamePattern4 ) * * ] 1 - 2 weeks , and if her TSH was still high at that time , they recommended thyroid replacements , but due to the course of her being in the Intensive Care Unit due to postoperative state , they did not feel that this was the appropriate time to treat this elevation in TSH .


The patient remained hemodynamically stable over the next couple of days , while we were initiating her Coumadin dosing .


She now has a therapeutic INR today of 2 . 2 and is ready to be discharged home .

Brief Hospital Course :


1 ) Aspiration pneumonia - Patient with CXR c / w aspiration pneumonia coupled with failure of swallow study .
2,3 Disorder|11,12 Disorder

Given this coupled with hypoxia and leukocytosis , asp pna most likely .
4,4 Disorder|6,6 Disorder|8,9 Disorder

Therefore the patient was started on vancomycin / levo / metronidazole .


As levofloxacin has SE of causing AMS in elderly it was changed to cefepime based on ID recommendations .
6,6 Disorder

The patient had improvement of hypoxia and was able to be weaned to nasal cannula .
5,5 Disorder

Other contributors to the hypoxia include flash pulm edema and PE though those were less likely given the patient 's ABG and improvement on abx .
4,4 Disorder|6,8 Disorder|10,10 Disorder

Was given diuresis while in ICU .


Upon transfer to floor , pt was sating mid 90s on 2L NC ; however remained tachypneic with RR in 30s .
16,16 Disorder

Evaluated by speech and swallow who could not make recommendations regarding pt 's nutrition as pt did not cooperate in participating in video swallow study .


Continued on Vanc / Cefepime / Flagyl for aspiration pna ( vanc for h / o MRSA in sputum ) .
8,9 Disorder

Noted to have WBC jump from 10 to 16 while on floor .


Not further worked up as family decided to make pt CMO , d / c 'd antibiotics , all blood draws , and IVFs .


Pt passed within 48 hrs of being made CMO .


2 ) Hypotension - Occasionally became occasionally hypotensive and responded to small fluid boluses .
2,2 Disorder|7,7 Disorder

Hypotension thought to be [ * * 01 - 22** ] infection , possible element of cardiogenic shock .
0,0 Disorder|11,11 Disorder|16,17 Disorder

Family did not wish for invasive procedures including CVLs and pressors .


3 ) NSTEMI - Pt with NSTEMI by enzymes and EKG changes , cardiology consulted who felt that pt was not good candidate for cath and opted for medical management .
2,2 Disorder|6,6 Disorder

Was on heparin gtt , which was d / c 'd in ICU as felt that risks outweighed benefits at this time .


Was on ASA and statin which were subsequently held during hospital course as pt did not pass initial speech and swallow evaluation .


Placed on standing IV lopressor .


4 ) A - fib c RVR - Pt occasionally with HR > 100 . Given Lopressor 5 IV standing and prn lopressor for rate control .
2,4 Disorder|6,6 Disorder

5 ) CHF - TTE on [ * * 10 - 12** ] significant for mild systolic CHF ( EF 50 % ) with 2 + MR [ * * First Name ( Titles ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( Titles ) * * ] .
2,2 Disorder|16,17 Disorder|26,26 Disorder

CXR and exam consistent with fluid overload .
5,6 Disorder

Pt was diuresed during [ * * Hospital Unit Name 221** ] course and given gentle diuresis on the floor .


Likely would have benefited from ACE - I ; however as was NPO , ACE - I not started .


6 ) Lethargy - Most likely secondary to infection .
2,2 Disorder|8,8 Disorder

Per family , pt somewhat interactive but responds poorly to questions , could also be progression of underlying dementia .
18,18 Disorder

During hospital course , pt was alternatively awake but not non - verbal and ocasionally difficult to arouse .


Avoided sedating meds .


Infectious w / u with abx as above .


7 ) Alzhemiers - Per family , pt is mostly non - verbal at baseline .
2,2 Disorder

8 ) Thrombocytosis - Possibly secondary to infection / acute phase reactant .
2,2 Disorder|7,7 Disorder

9 ) Anemia - baseline hct 37 - 38 . Iron studies done in March suggests anemia of chronic disease .
2,2 Disorder|16,19 Disorder

10 ) FEN - Pt had speech and swallow evaluation given concern for aspiration pneumonia and did not pass initial exam .
13,14 Disorder

Was ordered for a video swallow study in which pt did not swallow barium mixed with juice , but rather regurgitated / spit it out , thus making video swallow study inconclusive .


Per speech and swallow , unable to give recs for feeding given failure to perform video swallow study .


Discussed nutrition situation with family who voiced strongly that pt would not want feeding tube .


Given overall poor prognosis , the family and HCP decided to make pt CMO .


11 ) Proph - pneumoboots . bowel regimen .


12 ) Access - PIV , family does not want CVL .


13 ) Code - DNR / DNI , confirmed with HCP on [ * * 10 - 14** ] . CMO .


14 ) Communication - HCP is granddaughter [ * * Name ( NI ) * * ] phone [ * * Telephone / Fax ( 2 ) 3448** ] , wife is [ * * Name2 ( NI ) 3287** ] ( [ * * Ethnicity * * ] speaking only ) # [ * * Telephone / Fax ( 2 ) 3449** ]


During hospital course , pt was made CMO after discussion with family and HCP . Within 48 hrs after passing , pt was made CMO .

7,8 Disorder|24,24,28,28 Disorder|24,26 Disorder

This collection has decreased in size compared to the prior study .
1,1 Disorder

No dilated bowel loops are seen .
1,3 Disorder

CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST : There is a Foley catheter in bladder .


However , there is an unusually large amount of air in the bladder and within the inferior dependent portion there is contrast material ( image 69 ) , ( also confirmed on the associated reformatted coronal and sagittal images ) .
9,9 Disorder

Please note that the patient did not have intravenous contrast on today 's exam and the patient 's prior study with intravenous contrast was nine days ago .


As such , the small amount of contrast seen in the bladder on today 's exam is suggestive of an enterovesical fistula .
7,7 Disorder|20,21 Disorder

There are enlarged inguinal nodes bilaterally .
2,4 Disorder

A small amount of fluid is seen adjacent to the uterus in the deep pelvis .
4,4 Disorder

Patient is status post colectomy .


IMPRESSION :

T - SPINE , AP AND LATERAL VIEWS : A moderate compression deformity of the T6 vertebra and a mild compression deformity of the fifth thoracic vertebra are seen .
11,12 Disorder|20,21 Disorder

These findings are new since [ * * 07 - 26** ] , 2006 .


A right - sided PICC line is present with its tip at the brachiocephalic / SVC junction .


Aortic arch calcification is noted .
2,2 Disorder

IMPRESSION : Compression fractures at T5 and T6 , new compared to 7 / 2006 .
2,3 Disorder

The precise chronicity of these findings is uncertain and could be assessed with MR [ * * First Name ( Titles ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( Titles ) 5638** ] necessary .


Brief Hospital Course :


Mrs . [ * * lastname 3842** ] was admitted to the surgery service on [ * * 2013 - 07 - 17** ] in care of Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] after being transferred from [ * * Hospital 5639** ] for sepsis .
51,51 Disorder

She had a Hickman catheter during admission at [ * * Hospital1 5628** ] , which was removed for suspicion of line sepsis and was reported to be positive for MRSA .
21,22 Disorder

She presented to [ * * Hospital1 2** ] with leukocytosis at 23 , and acute renal failure with creatinine at 2 . 3 .
10,10 Disorder|15,17 Disorder

Upon admission she was started on Fluconazole and Linezolid .


An ophthalmology consult was obtained to rule out retinitis , secondary to suspect bacteremia / fungemia , which was negative .
8,8 Disorder|13,13 Disorder|15,15 Disorder

An echo was completed to rule out endocarditis , which was negative .
7,7 Disorder

Two units of blood were transfused for low hematocrit .


Urinalysis and urine culture were collected and were negative for infection .
10,10 Disorder

On HD3 she experienced decreased urine output which was treated with intravenous hydration .
5,6 Disorder

Her gastrostomy tube was rewired to a gastrojejunostomy by interventional radiology .


She was then started on tube feeds .


On HD4 blood cultures were sent and these were negative for infection .
11,11 Disorder

On HD 5 a central line was placed .


TPN with NephrAmine was initiated .


On HD6 she experienced nausea and vomiting ; her abdomen was distended .
4,4 Disorder|6,6 Disorder|9,9,11,11 Disorder

She was placed NPO and abdominal films were obtained which were negative for obstruction .
13,13 Disorder

Her ostomy output was decreased , and for this , her ostomy was dilated and a catheter placed to maintain patency .


Because her central line was found to be initially positioned in an accessory vein , rewire attempts were made , however it was found that her left brachial cephalic vein was occluded and therefore the catheter could only be placed in an accessory hemiazygos vein .
31,31 Disorder

On HD 7 there was a small area of fluid collection with erythema at her midline abdomen above the ostomy site .
9,10 Disorder|12,12 Disorder

This was incised and drained of purulent fluid and sent for culture which showed rare growth of yeast , presumptively not c . albicans .


At this point in her hospital stay she was moderately depressed .
10,10 Disorder

Physical therapy was consulted to begin rehabilitation and improve mobility , but she was not motivated to participate .


Psychiatry was consulted to evaluate her depressed mood .
6,7 Disorder

It was recommended that she continue her Wellbutrin in order to allow for affect and start on Dexedrine to increase her energy levels .


These recommendations were followed .


By HD 10 her Linezolid was stopped and she was taking Zosyn to treat her cellulitic areas at the midline of her abdomen .
15,15 Disorder

Her TPN was advanced and she was getting out of bed to chair for short periods of time .


She remained afebrile and her creatinine and urine output were normalizing .
2,2 Disorder

She continued to complain of pain at her left arm and sternum for which she was receiving IV pain medication .
5,5 Disorder|18,18 Disorder

For this , a PCA was provided .


In addition to pain , she also complained of left arm weakness for which Neurology was consulted to evaluate .
3,3 Disorder|9,11 Disorder

From this consult there was some concern for cervical spine pathology ; a MRI was recommended .
8,10 Disorder

However , due to her recent history of acute renal failure , this was not completed .
8,10 Disorder

By HD15 her cultures were negative and she remained afebrile .
9,9 Disorder

Hence , her antibiotics were discontinued .


At HD 20 she was more participative and her mood was improved .
9,9 Disorder

An abdominal CT scan was performed after renal protection with hydration , Mucomyst and bicarbonate .


The scan showed an interval increase in the size of the anterior abdominal wall collection , which appeared to communicate with the bowel .
12,14 Disorder

There was an adjacent intraperitoneal collection .
4,5 Disorder

On HD 22 a fistula gram was performed through the patient 's end ileostomy .
4,4 Disorder

No opacification of a fistulous tract was identified .
1,1 Disorder|4,5 Disorder

Whistle - tip catheter was placed into the ostomy and sutured into place .


On HD 23 a chest CT without contrast was performed to evaluate for sternal fracture , as she continued to have reproducible chest pain and her chest xrays were negative .
13,14 Disorder|22,23 Disorder

This showed a mildly displaced and angulated inferior manubrial fracture .
4,4,9,9 Disorder|6,6,9,9 Disorder

On HD 24 she manifested low grade temperatures .
5,7 Disorder

Blood and urine cultures were obtained and she was set up to have her PICC line changed for possible line sepsis .
19,20 Disorder

Ceftriaxone and Fluconazole were started .


At HD 27 she was found to have two enterocutaneous fistula sites adjacent to her ileostomy which were integrated into her ostomy pouch by the wound care nurse .
9,10 Disorder|25,25 Disorder

On HD 30 her WBC count was elevated at > 30 and she did not appear well .


Her tube feedings were stopped and Zosyn was started .


A CT scan of the abdomen was performed to evaluate for septic source which showed air and contrast in the bladder , suggestive of an enterovesical fistula .
11,11 Disorder|15,15 Disorder|17,17 Disorder|25,26 Disorder

No significant fluid collections were noted .
2,3 Disorder

At this point her blood cultures drawn from the onset of her low grade temperatures were negative and her urine culture was found to have fecal contamination .
12,14 Disorder

She was transferred to the ICU for further care .


On admission to the ICU she was started on Vancomycin and Caspofungin , in addition to her Zosyn .


Her Wellbutrin , Paxil , and Dexedrine were discontinued per psychiatry recommendation during this acute period .


Her tube feedings and TPN were continued .


At this point the original PICC line that was supposed to be rewired at HD 25 was still in place , as there was difficulty scheduling her for interventional radiology .


This was also delayed due to her acute illness and transfer to ICU .
8,8 Disorder

Previous cultures drawn from the PICC site were negative and due to her highly elevated WBC at > 30 , line sepsis was low on the differential for infectious source .
20,21 Disorder|28,28 Disorder

The enterovescicular fistula supported a more likely diagnosis of urosepsis .
1,2 Disorder|9,9 Disorder

On HD 34 repeat blood cultures were negative , MRSA and VRE screens came back positive .


She was doing better , was afebrile , and her leukocytosis was trending downward .
6,6 Disorder|10,10 Disorder

Her Vancomycin was changed to Linezolid for VRE and her Caspofungin was discontinued .


On HD 36 she was transferred back to the floor and her PICC line was exchanged over wire , with the tip sent for culture .


After the PICC line was changed she had an episode of hypoglycemia , with a BS of 47 .
11,11 Disorder

She was difficult to arouse and hypotensive .
6,6 Disorder

Her BS and pressure came back to baseline after 1 amp of D50 , her cardiac enzymes were negative x 3 .


On HD 37 her TPN was stopped . [ * * Last Name ( un ) 52** ] was consulted to evaluate and treat her labile blood glucose .


She was started on Lantus with sliding scale coverage .


At this point she continued to cry regarding pain medication .
8,8 Disorder

We started her on Fentanyl patch , Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] talked with her regarding dependency issues with narcotics , and her Diluadid was weaned .
24,24 Disorder

At HD 40 her sodium was consistently low and she was started on maintenance IV normal saline .


When there was no response , 3 % hypertonic saline was started daily .


At HD 49 she continued with low sodium .


Her potassium was elevated to 5 . 7 .


In suspecting adrenal suppression , a cortisol stem test was completed which was within normal parameters .
2,3 Disorder

She was also experiencing intermittent episodes of nausea and emesis .
7,7 Disorder|9,9 Disorder

A KUB was performed and was negative for obstruction .
8,8 Disorder

At HD 50 psychiatry continued to evaluate .


They felt that she showed some improvement since discharge from the ICU , but found her to exhibit catatonic properties on physical exam .
18,18 Disorder

They recommended discontinuing Reglan and Paxil which was followed .


Although the cortisol stem test was normal , hydrocortisone was ordered to see if her electrolytes would normalize .


Fludrocortisone was started on a daily basis .


Her Zosyn and Linezolid courses were completed and Bactrim was started to treat her urinary infection r / t her enterovescicular fistula .
14,15 Disorder|20,21 Disorder

At HD 56 she was doing better from a psychosocial standpoint .


She was doing better with pain and rarely asked for pain medication .
5,5 Disorder|10,10 Disorder

She was agreeable to work with physical therapy and was walking via walker and assistance .


Her mood had improved and her catatonia was resolving .
1,1 Disorder|6,6 Disorder

However , she was experiencing more nausea and vomiting and it was felt that it would be best to start back her Reglan so that she could tolerate tube feeds .
6,6 Disorder|8,8 Disorder

At HD 58 the hypertonic saline was discontinued , as it was not improving her sodium level .


The reglan appeared to improve her nausea and vomiting .
6,6 Disorder|8,8 Disorder

Her tube feeds were advanced .


At HD 60 it was unclear if the Floricet was improving her electrolyte imbalance and so it was stopped .
12,13 Disorder

At HD 62 she complained of back pain .
6,7 Disorder

There was an area of questionable deformity and tenderness at her thoracic spine .
6,6 Disorder|8,8 Disorder

No ecchymosis noted .
1,1 Disorder

A thoracic spine film was done which showed compression fractures at T5 and T6 new from 7 / 2006 .
8,9 Disorder

There was no history or report of injury .
7,7 Disorder

It was this day that her insurance company visited her in the hospital .


They did not want her to stay in the hospital any longer .


However they would not approve acute rehabilitation and we did not feel that it was safe to send her to a [ * * Hospital1 39** ] related to her need for frequent electrolyte replacement and monitoring .


On HD 64 her g - tube was clamped and a soft diet was started which she tolerated well .


She continued to work with physical therapy and was walking with walker .


Her diet was advanced to regular and she seemed to tolerate this for a couple of days until she began to have frequent emesis .
23,23 Disorder

Her HOB was elevated > 30 degrees and we limited food after 5pm however this did not decrease her vomiting .
19,19 Disorder

Hence we un clamped her G - tube and placed her NPO with allowance of ~60ml ice chips or water per hour .


A KUB was negative for obstruction .
5,5 Disorder

Her Reglan was increased to 10mg q6 hours .


It was difficult to keep her Magnesium and Phosphate repleted and so we started her on Magnesium injections every other day and Neutra - Phos twice daily .


At HD69 her sodium was low and her potassium was elevated to 6 . 3 .


EKG showed peaked t - waves and cardiac enzymes were negative for acute event .
12,13 Disorder

She was monitored closely .


She was treated with Insulin / D50 and Lasix .


Her tube feeds were changed from impact to Nepro 1 / 2 strength .


Fludorocortisone was restarted .


A repeat urine culture showed Citrobacter sensitive to imipenem .


Her Bactrim was stopped and imipenem started .


At HD 73 she was doing better .


Her sodium and potassium had improved and a repeat urine culture showed <10 , 000 organisms .


On [ * * 2013 - 09 - 27** ] she was discharged to [ * * Last Name ( un ) 5640** ] Acute Rehabilitation in stable condition .


Her tube feeds were Nepro 1 / 2 strength at 65 with 26g Bene protein .


Her G - tube remained un clamped and she was taking ~ 60ml / hr PO without problems .


She was to have 5 more days of IV Imipenem .

HOSPITAL COURSE : After reviewing the endoscopic photos and discussing his options with Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 704** ] the patient opted for an elective Ivor - [ * * Doctor Last Name 238** ] esophagogastrectomy .


He presents on [ * * 03 - 29** ] for that procedure .


Please refer to the previously dictated operative note by Dr . [ * * First Name8 ( NamePattern2 ) 703** ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern1 ) 704** ] from [ * * 2016 - 03 - 29** ] for the specifics of this surgery .


In brief , an


Ivor - [ * * Doctor Last Name 238** ] esophagogastrectomy was performed with resection of the tumor at the junction of the stomach and distal esophagus .
17,17 Disorder

The specimen was sent for pathology .


Eventually the pathology returned to show a well differentiated adenocarcinoma , T1 with no involvement in 13 adjacent lymph nodes .
9,9 Disorder

There is no lymphatic or venous invasion .


Margins were all clear .


In addition , during this procedure a feeding jejunostomy was placed as well as bilateral chest tubes .


The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the floor on subcutaneous heparin twice a day and an epidural for his pain control .
23,23 Disorder

The patient was doing well postoperatively until postoperative day two .


The patient was noted to have respiratory distress with markedly decreasing oxygen saturation , tachypnea , tachycardia and significant confusion .
6,7 Disorder|14,14 Disorder|16,16 Disorder|19,19 Disorder

In fact he pulled out his nasogastric tube at this point .


He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit .


A arterial blood gas at this time showed a pH of 7 . 52 , PCO2 of 32 , PO2 of 60 , bicarb of 27 and a base deficit of 3 .


Because of his significant AA gradient the patient was intubated at this time .


Workup for the respiratory distress included a CTA of the chest , which revealed bilateral pulmonary emboli in the right upper lobe and left lower lobe .
3,4 Disorder|15,16 Disorder

The patient was started on a heparin drip and was soon having therapeutic anticoagulation .


On postoperative day three the patient 's nasogastric tube was replaced under fluoroscopy .


His deep veins in his lower and upper extremities were examined for thrombotic sources of pulmonary emboli , however , none were noted on these studies .
12,12 Disorder|15,16 Disorder

His respiratory status improved and he was extubated .


On the morning of postoperative day four the patient had again another bout of significant hypoxia with a large AA gradient .
15,15 Disorder

It was determined that he had a recurrent pulmonary emboli despite being on therapeutic heparin .
8,9 Disorder

At this point it was decided that he should have an inferior vena cava filter placement .


This was placed by the Vascular Service on postoperative day five and the patient tolerated the procedure without any complications .


The patient remained well for the next few days and on postoperative day nine was reextubated .


At this time he was noted to be at his goal tube feedings .


On [ * * 04 - 08** ] a swallow study revealed no leak at the patient 's esophagogastric anastomosis .
13,13,18,19 Disorder

The patient 's nasogastric tube was discontinued and he was transferred to the floor from the Intensive Care Unit .


The next day the patient was started on clears .


In addition he had his chest tubes removed without complications .


The other remaining issues while the patient was on the floor revolved around preparing the patient for home .


Basically his nutritional status was buffed .


By the time he was being discharged the patient was on a regular post esophagogastrectomy diet with six small meals a day .


In addition for nutritional supplementation he received cycle tube feeds at night .


He was also put on oral anticoagulation with Coumadin and once his INR was greater then 2 it was determined that he was able to go home on oral Coumadin .


His primary care physician [ * * Initials ( NamePattern4 ) * * ] . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 6780** ] was consulted and agreed to follow his INR as an outpatient .


While on the unit he had been placed on antibiotics for several positive sputum cultures .


These antibiotics were discontinued prior to discharge and finally a physical therapy evaluation determined that he was ready to go home and that he did not need outpatient rehab treatment .


Therefore on [ * * 2016 - 04 - 17** ] , which was postoperative day 19 the patient was tolerating a regular diet .


He was afebrile for the last several days and he was properly anticoagulated for his pneumothorax .
2,2 Disorder|15,15 Disorder

He was discharged home in good condition .

Brief Hospital Course :


1 .


Proteus Bacteremia - Pt was continued on ceftriaxone for proteus bacteremia .
1,1 Disorder|10,10 Disorder

He defervesced after first day .


His cultures from L heel ulcer also grew dense proteus so this was felt to be the source .
4,5 Disorder

The patient will be continued on IV 1g QD ceftriaxone for 4 weeks from [ * * 2013 - 09 - 06** ] and Vancomycin 750mg QHD for 2more weeks ( given history of MRSA OM ) for osteomyelitis but duration will be determined by outpatient Podiatry Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 3307** ] and will depend on how wound is heeling .
35,35 Disorder|38,38 Disorder|64,64 Disorder

2 .


PVD - The worsening of his heel ulcer over the prior 2 weeks was found to be secondary to decreased flow in his L bypass graft .
0,0 Disorder|6,7 Disorder|19,20 Disorder

Vascular was consulted and arteriogram was performed on [ * * 09 - 10** ] by Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] and angioplasty was successfully performed on distal graft .


Given the improvement in his distal blood flow it was felt that the L heel osteomyelitis might respond to conservative treatment with abx and wound care .
15,15 Disorder|24,24 Disorder

The patient is to follow up with Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 3307** ] and Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] to assess progression of wound and vascular status .

3 .


Rectus sheath hematoma - During hospital course pt developed rectus sheath hematoma at sight of heparin injections .
0,2 Disorder|9,11 Disorder

ASA which had briefly been started was d / c 'd for good along with hep sq inj .


Pt 's Hct drifted down to 25 so he required several blood transfusions to aim for Hct > 30 .


Given his thrombocytopenia ( plts as low as 30 ) he was transfused several bags of plts to keep count > 100 .
2,2 Disorder

The hematoma stabilized so pt was felt stable for d / c with plans to recheck Hct and plts at HD and transfuse to keep Hct > 30 and Plts > 50 .
1,1 Disorder

4 . ESRD - Pt was continued on HD MWF . All medications were renally dosed . He was continued on Epo at HD .
2,2 Disorder

5 .


Neuro - Pt was admitted with mental status change that improved with treatment of infection .
6,8 Disorder|14,14 Disorder

He had a MRI of his head which revealed diffuse microvascular dz but no acute CVA .
10,11 Disorder|15,15 Disorder

Currently holding antiplatelet agents given low plt count . Patient with 90 % stenosis of R carotid artery , however refusing surgical intervention .
13,13,16,17 Disorder

6 .


Pain - The patient has some pain from the ulcer , as well as from the rectus sheath hematoma .
0,0 Disorder|6,6 Disorder|9,9 Disorder|16,18 Disorder

We have started oxycodone 2 . 5 mg QID , as well as PRN , which is keeping his pain well - controlled .
19,19 Disorder

He may be switched to longer acting meds once at rehab .


We found that a dose of 5 mg of oxycodone q 6 hours caused confusion .
14,14 Disorder

7 .


Code status - Code status was discussed with patient and family .


He again affirmed that he was DNR / DNI .


Given his poor prognosis , goals of care were discussed and patient and family agreed to current treatment plan which included antibiotics and transfusions as necessary but avoiding major surgical interventions .


Things should be discussed with patient and family as they arise on a situational basis .

His course was complicated by a DVT and PE at the time of his diagnosis , and he was on anticoagulation particularly while receiving thalidomide and Decadron .
6,6 Disorder|8,8 Disorder

He was noted for a very good response to his treatment with a repeat bone marrow biopsy in [ * * 2016 - 02 - 23** ] showing 5 % plasma cells as well as marked improvement in his lesion in the sacral area .
39,39 Disorder

In April / 05 , he was noted to have a drop in his white blood count , and repeat bone marrow biopsy showed increasing plasma cells with 20 % involvement .
11,16 Disorder

His IgG level had also increased with a concern for more refractory disease .
1,2,5,5 Disorder|11,12 Disorder

He received a cycle of DVD chemotherapy on [ * * 2016 - 03 - 31** ] .


Following this therapy , he had increasing pain with increasing IgG levels and SPEP with a poor response to therapy , he was switched to treatment with Velcade and Decadron .
7,7 Disorder|9,11 Disorder

He was given four cycles of this therapy .


A repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy revealed CD138 staining of plasma cells for approximately 10 % of the cellularity .


His IgG level had decreased to a low of 1680 .
1,2,4,4 Disorder

His SPEP had also decreased to 1100 mg / dL of the total protein .


He then received high - dose Cytoxan on [ * * 2016 - 06 - 30** ] in preparation for stem cell mobilization with his stem cell collections completed during the week of [ * * 2016 - 07 - 11** ] .


He then was admitted on [ * * 2016 - 07 - 29** ] for high - dose chemotherapy with melphalan followed by stem cell transplant .


Followup evaluation of his disease at 2 months post - transplant at the end of [ * * 2016 - 09 - 24** ] showed approximately 10 % involvement by plasma cells by CD138 staining .
4,4 Disorder

This was essentially stable , and he was continued to be monitored .


His IgG level had decreased to 1314 following his transplant .
1,2,4,4 Disorder

On [ * * 11 - 02 - 23** ] , pt has increasing pain in the left groin area .

6,7,10,10 Disorder

He underwent a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy by his local oncologist , Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 5568** ] , which revealed extensive relapsed disease with plasma cell myeloma accounting for 80 - 90 % of the core biopsy specimen .
29,30 Disorder|32,34 Disorder

As a result of this , it was felt that Mr . [ * * lastname 5569** ] required more systemic therapy in addition to continuing the radiation therapy to the groin area , he was started Velcade with Decadron [ * * 2017 - 02 - 06** ] .


He had been requiring increasing platelet transfusion support prior to beginning Velcade as well as during the course of Velcade with a platelet count less than 20 , 000 as well as red blood cell transfusion support , his IgG level had increased to 7 g with his SPEP now representing 50 % or 4900 mg / dL of the total protein .
39,40,42,42 Disorder

He was started on more aggressive chemotherapy with D - PACE on [ * * 2017 - 02 - 08** ] .


Within one week , he was noted for an increase of his IgG to over 6 g .
9,9,12,12 Disorder

As he clearly had an agressive refractory myeloma , he is being admitted for with a myeloablative transplant with cytoxan and busulfan conditioning .

EP was consulted and recommended increasing the PO diltiazem to 90 mg and continuing with dofetolide .


If his rate was not controlled they suggested loading with digoxin or amiodarone .


Since dofetilide prolongs QT , daily EKGs were obtained to make sure the pt did not have QTc greater than 500 .


No additional QT prolonging medications were to be added to his regimen ( levaquin and dilt had already been started ) .


Cr was also closely monitored per pharmacy recs .


He was stable on diltiazem and difetolide and occasionally went back into NSR .

Patient was quickly placed on broad spectrum antibiotics .


Given patient 's history of a / fib , suspicion was made that perhaps patient had ischemic bowel or mesentery ischemia .
5,7 Disorder|16,16 Disorder|20,20 Disorder

General surgery was then consulted who agreed that patient was at high risk for mesenteric ischemia and given her clinical picture , this may , indeed , be the diagnosis .
15,15 Disorder

Therefore , patient was taken to the operating room and underwent exploratory laparotomy which , unfortunately , did not show any signs of ischemic bowel or any other intra - abdominal pathology to explain her sudden decompensation .
23,23 Disorder|28,31 Disorder

At this point the nephrology service was also consulted and they placed patient on CVVHD to help control her acidosis as well as her renal decompensation .
19,19 Disorder|24,25 Disorder

Two days later her culture returned gram negative rods in her blood , also gram negative rods in the sputum .


Eventually these gram negative rods turned out to be Enterobacter which was sensitive to the antibiotics she was placed on .


She was placed on Zosyn , gentamicin and vancomycin .


In the next day or so her clinical condition actually improved with her creatinine discomfort from as high as 3 to 1 . 7 and she was making an adequate amount of urine , up to 1700 cc per day .


Moreover her pressor drips were able to come down very slowly .


On [ * * 10 - 28** ] suddenly patient once again decompensated .


Her urine output decreased .
1,2 Disorder

Moreover her acidosis returned and her white count suddenly increased again to the 30s .
2,2 Disorder|6,7,9,9 Disorder

Patient underwent ultrasound which revealed thickened gallbladder wall , pericholecystic fluid and sludge in the gallbladder , all of which could be explained from previous laparotomy as well as her septic physiology .
5,5 Disorder|9,10 Disorder|12,12 Disorder|30,30 Disorder

However , given the fact that we had no obvious source of her bacteremia , general surgery made the decision to reexplore her in the operating room .
13,13 Disorder

On [ * * 10 - 28** ] patient was taken back to the operating room of reexploration of her abdomen .


Intraoperatively once again there was no obvious pathology found , however , a cholecystostomy tube was placed given the fact that patient had the ultrasound which suggested that she may have cholecystitis and she does have evidence of stones .
31,31 Disorder|38,38 Disorder

Postoperatively , however , patient did not improve clinically and continued to require tremendous amounts of pressors which included dopamine at 10 , Levophed at 0 . 5 , milrinone at 0 . 5 ,


Neo at 10 , Pitressin at 0 . 1 .


The next few days patient did not show any signs of improvement whatsoever .


Her extremities became more and more mottled secondary to the tremendous amount of pressor agents that she was on .
6,6 Disorder

Despite adding fluconazole to her antibiotic regimen , patient did not improve .


In fact , her blood pressure consistently dropped , requiring going up on the pressors .


On [ * * 10 - 31** ] epinephrine was added to her pressor agents .


This , too , did not help her blood pressure .


Her blood pressure remained very tenuous in the high 70s systolic blood pressure .


On[**Last Name ( STitle ) 4537** ] , patient 's family met with the attending , Dr . [ * * Name Prefix ( Prefixes ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( Prefixes ) * * ] , and discussed her poor prognosis .


Family agreed at that point to make patient DNR and agreed to no escalation of her treatment .


On [ * * 11 - 01** ] at 7 : 00 p . m . patient 's vital signs began to drop and she expired at exactly 7 : 00 p . m . on [ * * 2013 - 11 - 01** ] .


At this point the family was contacted and was notified , specifically [ * * First Name4 ( NamePattern1 ) * * ] [ * * lastname 4538** ] , patient 's brother , was notified , who , unfortunately , did not agree to a post mortem autopsy .


Moreover the attending , Dr . [ * * First Name4 ( NamePattern1 ) * * ] [ * * Name Prefix ( Prefixes ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( Prefixes ) * * ] , was also notified .

Brief Hospital Course :


71 y / o male resistant to medical care who presented with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia .
12,14 Disorder|16,16 Disorder

The following issues were addressed during this admission .


The patient was initially admitted to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name * * ] for closer monitoring and transferred to the medical floor prior to discharge to rehab .


1 . Acute Renal failure
2,4 Disorder

The pt was admitted to the ICU after he was found to be in severe acute renal failure accompanied by hyperkalemia .
15,17 Disorder|20,20 Disorder

U / A was significant for muddy brown casts and FeNa of 8 % .


In addition , he had large left - sided hydronephrosis secondary to anatomic displacement of the left kidney by an enlarged spleen .
9,9 Disorder|12,13 Disorder|20,21 Disorder

No stones or other causes were identified for the obstructive picture .


He was initiated on HD on admission for hyperkalemia after a right femoral HD line was placed on [ * * 2014 - 07 - 07** ] , which improved with one session .
8,8 Disorder

He underwent an IR placement of a left percutaneous nephrostomy tube on [ * * 2014 - 07 - 09** ] for relief of the hydronephrosis .
25,25 Disorder

A tunneled HD cath was placed on [ * * 2014 - 07 - 11** ] .


Pt will need to have continued HD via the tunneled line that was placed by IR .


The pt was followed by the renal team during this admission and will continue to follow the pt at [ * * Hospital * * ] Rehab .


He will resume a MWF HD schedule upon discharge to [ * * Hospital * * ] Rehab .


2 . Pancytopenia / Splenomegaly
2,2 Disorder|4,4 Disorder

There was concern for a hematologic malignancy given the leukopenia .
5,6 Disorder|9,9 Disorder

Hepatitis viral serologies were negative , parvovirus IgM , and HIV AB 's negative .


He was transfused during admission .


He was also given 1 bag of platelets and 2 doses of dDAVP given his uremic platelets .


Hemolysis labs on admission were negative , no evidence of TTP on peripheral smear .
10,10 Disorder

Pt had oozing from his temporary HD catheter , tunneled line catheter as well as hematuria which caused no appropriate bump in his hct .
2,2 Disorder|15,15 Disorder

He was given DDAVP , plts , and PRBC for blood loss .
10,11 Disorder

His oozing from lines resolved eventually and his hct remained stable for 24 hours prior to transfer to the floor .
1,1 Disorder

Heme - onc has been following and a bone - marrow bx was performed on [ * * 2014 - 07 - 09** ] .


In addition , flow cytometry has been sent and is consistent with mantle cell lymphoma .
12,14 Disorder

FISH analysis confirmed mantle cell lymphoma .
3,5 Disorder

Extensive discussion took place with the pt and his sister regarding the diagnosis .


The pt will follow up with Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 1176** ] in one week for further management of his mantle cell lymphoma .
26,28 Disorder

Given that his splenomegaly will not resolve without treatment , his left nephrostomy tube will stay in place until he follows up with urology in 3 months .
3,3 Disorder

Rehab will perform routine nephrostomy care .


If pt elects to have treatment , it would be 3 or more weeks after discharge .


3 . Lung lesions
2,3 Disorder

Patient underwent a CTA on [ * * 2014 - 07 - 09** ] to r / o PE as he developed sudden - onset tachycardia and hypoxia .
18,18 Disorder|25,25 Disorder|27,27 Disorder

This was negative for PE and his symptoms were likely [ * * 03 - 07** ] volume overload from blood products .
4,4 Disorder|17,18 Disorder

However , the CTA demonstrated nodular opacities in the RUL and opacities in the LUL .
5,6 Disorder|11,11 Disorder

This was reviewed the [ * * Hospital Unit Name * * ] attending who did not feel an active infection was present .
20,20 Disorder

He has not had any symptoms of fever , cough , or productive sputum .
7,7 Disorder|9,9 Disorder|12,13 Disorder

A sputum cx was also ordered , but the patient has not produced any to give an adequate sample .


Given these abnormal findings and the fact that the patient will need chemotherapy , he will likely need a bronch prior to proceeding with treatment for his lymphoma .
27,27 Disorder

# Hematuria - patient developed persistent hematuria with few clots beginning on [ * * 2014 - 07 - 09** ] after changing his foley .
1,1 Disorder|6,6,9,9 Disorder

On [ * * 2014 - 07 - 12** ] , his foley stopped draining any urine but his bladder scan demonstrated 400 cc , foley did not flush .


Blood was noted around the meatus at that time .


Foley was removed and changed to a cudet with good drainage .


Urology saw the patient and did not have any other additional recs .


# Elevated troponin - likely in setting of severe renal failure , CK - MB flat .

He was also started on an ACE - I .


ASA is being held given the thrombocytopenia and dysfunction platelets and oozing blood from lines and hematuria .
6,6 Disorder|11,11 Disorder|16,16 Disorder

# Positive U / A - patient is on day 3 of ciprofloxacin , urine cx grew staph , however without significant growth . His antibiotics were discontinued .


# Capacity - patient was initially sectioned 12 by his PCP as he has been resistant to medical care and there was concern for whether he had capacity to make his decisions .


He has been cooperative with all medical treatments since his admission .


Psychiatry saw the patient and deemed him to have capacity to make his decisions ; however , if he becomes uncooperative with medical treatments , they need to be contacted , as there is some concern whether the patient has full understanding of the situation .


His sister is also involved in his care .


Social work has also been involved .

Brief Hospital Course :


1 .


Sinus pauses : Neurology was consulted , as pt with poorly controlled seizure disorder .
0,1 Disorder|12,13 Disorder

Most likely etiology of sinus pauses felt to be that IV dilantin was loaded too quickly , causing SA nodal blockade .
4,5 Disorder|18,20 Disorder

Pt was monitored on telemetry and had no further pauses overnight .


He was asymptomatic .


EP was consulted , and they felt that in the setting of preserved EF , he does not qualify for ICD placement ; further , pharmacologic treatment not indicated at this time .


Atropine and pacer pads were kept close to the patient , and were not needed .


2 .


Seizure disorder : History of poorly controlled seizure disorder , most likely in the setting of alcohol use .
0,1 Disorder|7,8 Disorder

Neurology felt that Keppra would be a good choice , as there are interactions between dilantin and HAART ; in addition , there are fewer side effects and adverse effects with Keppra .


Pt was therefore started on Keppra 500mg bid , with a plan to increase to 750mg po bid in 5 days , and then to increase to target goal of 1000mg po bid .


During this time , he would be maintained on Dilantin , as well .


Pt had no further seizures in the hospital .
