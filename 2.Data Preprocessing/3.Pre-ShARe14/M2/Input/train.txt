HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS : Mr . [ * * lastname * * ] originally presented to an outside hospital on [ * * 07 - 15** ] with bright red blood per rectum , where he underwent a colonoscopy .
30,34 Disorder

This did not show any evidence of bleeding .
7,7 Disorder

He was sent home , but he was readmitted on the [ * * 07 - 17** ] with an increase in volume of stools , and he underwent a repeat colonoscopy at the outside hospital .
22,24 Disorder

He was again negative by colonoscopy and he was discharged home and he was hemodynamically stable .


On the [ * * 07 - 23** ] , he passed bowel movement and clots in large amounts to a total output of 1700 cubic centimeters .

He became hemodynamically stable and he was transferred to the [ * * Hospital 1026** ] , where he had a bleeding
21,21 Disorder

scan , EGD , upper GI series and a small bowel follow through .


All of these studies were negative .


He then underwent a bleeding scan at [ * * Hospital 1026** ] , which was negative for acute bleeding , but which showed pooling blood .
4,4 Disorder|18,19 Disorder|24,25 Disorder

He then underwent an angiography in an attempt to identify the bleeding vessels .
11,12 Disorder

Angiography was also undertaken to identify the bleeding vessel to guide surgical intervention and to attempt occlusion of the bleeding vessel .
7,8 Disorder|19,20 Disorder

At intervention radiology / angiography , the bleeding vessel was identified , however , attempted occlusion of this bleeding blood vessel was unsuccessful .
7,8 Disorder|18,20 Disorder

After being transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit , where Mr . [ * * lastname * * ] received numerous transfusion of packed red blood cells and crystalloid , Mr . [ * * lastname * * ] was prepared for surgery and underwent a subtotal colectomy on [ * * 2013 - 07 - 27** ] .


Intraoperatively , Mr . [ * * lastname * * ] received 7 . 2 liters crystalloid , had an estimated blood loss of 500 cc and urine output of 350 cc .


Incidental finding at the time of surgery was that Mr . [ * * lastname * * ] was asplenic , presumably because his spleen had been removed at the time of his prior surgery for bleeding diverticula - a right hemicolectomy .
19,19 Disorder|36,37 Disorder

The procedure was without complication .
4,4 Disorder

The patient was transferred to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit in stable condition .

On postoperative day # 4 , a series of Lasix doses were started in an attempt to gently diurese the fluid that Mr . [ * * lastname * * ] had received during his surgery .


This was intended to augment the normal diuresis of third space fluid following his surgery .


As Mr . [ * * Name13 ( STitle ) 6879** ] abdomen remained distended , through postoperative day # 7 , he was started on total parenteral nutrition on that day and this continued until he was taking adequate nutrition PO .
12,12,14,14 Disorder

On postoperative day # 9 , Mr . [ * * lastname * * ] was started on a diet of clear liquids , which he tolerated fairly well .


But , he continued to have mild to moderate abdominal distention with minimal tenderness .
9,9,13,13 Disorder|9,10 Disorder

He was continued on a regimen of IV and then PO Lasix to continue his diuresis of fluids and the abdominal examination was followed serially until it was felt that he was tolerating the clear diet well and solid foods could be reintroduced .


On postoperative day # 11 , as Mr . [ * * lastname * * ] was being screened for discharge from the [ * * Hospital 1026** ] , it was noted that he continued to have an oxygen requirement , which he did not have prior to his admission to the hospital .


Portable chest x - ray taken at that time showed no pneumonia , but some suggestion of pulmonary edema .
11,11 Disorder|17,18 Disorder

More vigorous diuresis using Lasix ( Furosemide ) was started and by postoperative day # 12 , Mr . [ * * Name13 ( STitle ) 6879** ] room air oxygen saturation was 98 % .

Service :


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : Mrs . [ * * lastname 225** ] is a 75 year old woman from [ * * Hospital 226** ] admitted on [ * * 2009 - 10 - 03** ] for evaluation for the question of dialysis .


The patient was last admitted to [ * * Hospital 227** ] [ * * Hospital 24** ] [ * * First Name ( Titles ) 25** ] [ * * Last Name ( Titles ) 26** ] on [ * * 2009 - 09 - 01** ] for workup of new onset acute renal failure , urosepsis , [ * * Last Name ( un ) 228** ] syndrome and chronic ventilatory dependence .
53,55 Disorder|57,57 Disorder|71,73 Disorder

She was discharged to [ * * Hospital 229** ] without dialysis as there was no indication then for dialysis .


The patient 's acute renal failure continued to worsen and she had a question of altered mental status , leading to this readmission , for workup of uremic encephalopathy and the requirement of dialysis .
3,5 Disorder|15,17 Disorder|27,28 Disorder

The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit because of ventilator dependence at night .
12,13 Disorder

ACTIVE ISSUES :


1 .


Acute renal failure : The patient had hyperkalemia on admission , which resolved with a Kayexalate enema and Lasix .
0,2 Disorder|7,7 Disorder

She was evaluated by the renal service and started bedside hemodialysis through a femoral line on [ * * 2009 - 10 - 05** ] .


No improvement of mental status was noticed after two days of dialysis .
3,4 Disorder

A family meeting was held on [ * * 2009 - 10 - 04** ] with the patient 's sister , who is her health care proxy , regarding the goals of our care for the patient .


We discussed at length regarding the need for hemodialysis , the need for a permanent catheter to be placed and regarding the overall prognosis of Mrs . [ * * lastname 225** ] .


The patient 's family decided to give her a trial of hemodialysis from her femoral line and observe what benefit it will bring , then they will decide regarding chronic hemodialysis .


Mrs . [ * * lastname 225** ] had minimal mental status improvement after two days of hemodialysis .
10,11 Disorder

The patient 's family decided on [ * * 2009 - 10 - 06** ] that they would not consent to further procedures or hemodialysis and would want only comfort measures for Mrs . [ * * lastname 225** ] .
29,30 Disorder

Hemodialysis was stopped on [ * * 2009 - 10 - 06** ] .


2 .


Ventilatory status : The patient was placed on 12 hours off ventilator wean on her first day , and was noted to have some apneic episodes and appear labored in her breathing .
24,24 Disorder|28,28,31,31 Disorder

We therefore placed her on 24 hour PSV then switched to AC in order to better ventilate her and to rule out any hypoxia , hypercarbia as a cause of her altered mental status .
23,23 Disorder|25,25 Disorder|31,33 Disorder

The patient 's family had decided on comfort measures only on
7,8 Disorder

[ * * 2009 - 10 - 07** ] .


The patient was then taken off the ventilator that afternoon and given oxygen over her tracheostomy mask .


She was not to be put on ventilator support from now on .


The patient is to receive morphine if she appears distressed from breathing .
9,9,11,11 Disorder

3 .


Urinary tract infection : On admission , a urinalysis was sent and the patient was found to have plenty of bacteria and yeast in her urine .
0,2 Disorder

Later , the urine culture came back to show Klebsiella pneumoniae , sensitive to Bactrim .


The patient is now treated , day number five of Bactrim DS on discharge .


4 .


Diabetes / hyperglycemia : The patient had been hyperglycemic during this admission , likely secondary to her urinary tract infection .
0,0 Disorder|2,2 Disorder|8,8 Disorder|17,19 Disorder

As the patient is now only comfort measures , she is getting her daily NPH at the same dose as on transfer , but no more daily fingersticks to check her blood sugar level .
6,7 Disorder

5 .


Nutrition : The patient is to receive no intravenous fluids .


She received 35 cc / hour of Nepro tube feeds and 250 cc of free water bolus through her nasogastric tube every day .


The family has not yet decided whether to stop tube feeding her and to remove her nasogastric tube .


6 .


Altered mental status : A CT scan was performed for further evaluation of possible causes of the patient 's mental status alteration and potential prognostication in terms of neurological status .
0,2 Disorder|19,21 Disorder

A CT scan of the head showed no acute infarction or hemorrhage , with small vessel disease in the periventricular white matter and an old putamen infarction .
9,9 Disorder|11,11 Disorder|14,16 Disorder|26,26 Disorder

7 .


Cardiovascular status : An echocardiogram was performed to evaluate the cardiovascular status of Mrs . [ * * lastname 225** ] .

Service : NEUROLOGY


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This is a 75 year - old man with a past medical history of cerebrovascular accident with residual right hemiparesis in [ * * 1998** ] as well as diabetes type 2 , coronary artery disease , status post catheterization in
19,20 Disorder|23,24 Disorder|34,36 Disorder|38,40 Disorder

[ * * 2011** ] with three vessel disease as well as cataracts , hyperlipidemia and bipolar disorder who is admitted to [ * * Hospital 20** ] on [ * * 2012 - 06 - 26** ] after he was found down in his home .
6,8 Disorder|12,12 Disorder|14,14 Disorder|16,17 Disorder|41,42 Disorder

He was diagnosed with a left basal ganglia intracranial hemorrhage likely arising from the caudate with large intraventricular extension on the left .
8,9 Disorder

He had subsequent hydrocephalus as well as an acute myocardial infarction with troponins going greater then 50 as well as rhabdomyolysis with a CK in the 10 , 000s .
3,3 Disorder|8,10 Disorder|20,20 Disorder

He was admitted to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit for closer blood pressure and neurologic monitoring .


It was felt early on as his decreased level of consciousness was profound he would need neurosurgical intervention with a right ventricular catheter .
7,10 Disorder

This was placed on [ * * 06 - 27** ] the day after admission .


After insertion the catheter continued to have 200 to 300 cc output a day of blood tinged fluid and his mental status seemed to improve .
20,21 Disorder

On admission he had low grade fevers 100 to 101 range with an increased white blood cell count of 90 . 5 .
4,6 Disorder|13,17 Disorder

Initial workup showed pneumonia with right upper lobe infiltrate and also a question of left lower lobe infiltrate .
3,3 Disorder|8,8 Disorder|17,17 Disorder

He was given Ancef initially for his drain on the first day , however , it was then changed to Levaquin as well as Flagyl in light of his cultures came back .


He required intubation on [ * * 06 - 30** ] .


He was later started on Vancomycin with cultures coming back as heavy growth MRSA .
13,13 Disorder

He was followed closely in the Neurosurgical Intensive Care


Unit , the Neurology , Neurosurgery and the CICU medical team .


He continued to recover from his myocardial infarction and his enzymes trended down .
6,7 Disorder

His neurological deficits remained significantly unchanged .
1,2 Disorder

He was in the Intensive Care Unit with cerebral spinal fluid samples taken on [ * * 06 - 30** ] , [ * * 07 - 02** ] and


[ * * 07 - 06** ] , which were all no growth and the patient continued to have fevers even on broad spectrum antibiotics with a white blood cell count of 12 to 16 .
19,19 Disorder

He was briefly extubated , but then needed to be reintubated the same night .


His sputum continued to grow large amounts of MRSA on repeat cultures .
8,8 Disorder

His blood and urine culture were negative as well as cerebral spinal fluid .


Vancomycin was held briefly from [ * * 07 - 09** ] to [ * * 07 - 10** ] , however , the patient 's temperature again increased to 102 and repeat cerebral spinal fluid from ventricular drain at this point showed 3 + polys , 3 + gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters within the fluid with 4000 white blood cells and 110 polys and a glucose of 1 .
26,26 Disorder

Ceftazidime was added .


Infectious disease was consulted at that time .


His neurological examination continued to wax and wane .


His vent drain was raised and lowered depending on his arousal .


He was noted to have also right [ * * Hospital Unit Name 78** ] deviation and right twitching of his mouth on two separate occasions , which is suspicious for seizure .
18,18 Disorder|31,31 Disorder

We ordered an electroencephalogram which was abnormal due to low voltage slow background with bursts of polymorphic data and delta frequency slowing .


This indicated a wide spread cortical dysfunction as well as dysfunction of the deep midline structures as can be seen with severe encephalopathy .
5,6 Disorder|10,10 Disorder|22,22 Disorder

There were no focal epileptiform seizures seen .
4,5 Disorder

At that point we decided to watch him .


Later on in his course he had another episode where his eyes were strongly deviated to the right and we could not doll him pass the midline .
11,11,14,14 Disorder

At that point it was felt by the neuro team that we should treat him for seizures .
16,16 Disorder

We loaded him on phenytoin and gave him Ativan with good relief of his seizures .
14,14 Disorder

There was no need at that time to repeat an electroencephalogram as his clinical suspicion was high enough for epileptiform events .
19,20 Disorder

We decided to continue with our management and watch his blood pressure , heart rate and temperature .


He continued to spike .


We involved infectious disease who felt that this was fever meningismus and he was not following commands .
9,10 Disorder

There was concern for meningitis and this should be treated with Vancomycin .
4,4 Disorder

We continued that per their recommendations as well and continued Rifampin per their recommendations also .


He continued to not improve clinically and his neurological examination was somewhat limited .


He could follow simple commands intermittently , but could not move his right side to command .


He could occasionally squeeze hand , but not consistently .


He could not also consistently follow commands , but he would open his eyes to voice .


He was intubated and sedated .


His respiratory coarse breath sounds bilaterally , decreased breath sounds .
2,4 Disorder|7,9 Disorder

His cardiac examination was regular rate and rhythm .


We continued to watch him and watch his laboratories , however , he was unable to improve much .


Pulmonary critical care team felt he would benefit from a tracheostomy and this was planned until other issues medically kept him from this procedure .


It was felt he was on a downhill course and meningitis , which was being treated intrathecal Vancomycin by the neurosurgical service and that his hope for a meaningful recovery was somewhat less then originally due to many additional medical issues that worsened during his hospital admission .
10,10 Disorder|38,40 Disorder

It was felt by the team and by his responsible family that he would be best made CMO .


He was then made CMO and kept in the Intensive Care Unit for two days before being transferred to the floor .


He was given morphine for comfort as well as Ativan for respiratory distress .
11,12 Disorder

On [ * * 07 - 19** ] , he was found to be pulseless and not breathing and on examination he was pronounced expired at 7 : 00 p . m . on [ * * 07 - 19** ] .
14,14 Disorder|16,17 Disorder

His nephew [ * * First Name4 ( NamePattern1 ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern1 ) * * ] was called at his home and arrangements were to be made by him to the funeral home .

Brief Hospital Course :


Pt admitted to surgery from the [ * * Doctor First Name * * ] .


Ct showed :


1 .


Prominent loops of proximal small bowel adjacent to an omental fat containing ventral hernia with fecalization of bowel contents , adjacent inflammatory fat stranding , and small amount of fluid and extraluminal air consistent with bowel ischemia and contained perforation .
0,1 Disorder|12,13 Disorder|15,18 Disorder|21,23 Disorder|35,36 Disorder|39,39 Disorder

There also is apparent caliber change just below the level of the ventral hernia within the small bowel loops , as the distal loops of small bowel are markedly collapsed .
12,13 Disorder|29,29 Disorder

All these findings are suggestive of interval reduction of an incarcerated hernia with high - grade bowel obstruction .

HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the Medicine


Intensive Care Unit . Given her high troponin levels ,


Cardiology was seen in consultation and they felt that it was not appropriate to cardiac catheterize the patient at that time .


Given her history of large bloody stool , the patient was not deemed a candidate for heparinization either .
5,6 Disorder

She was maintained on Aspirin , Beta blocker and as lytes improved an ACE inhibitor was added as well .


During her course in the hospital the patient did continue to have transient chest pain which was often relieved by Nitroglycerin but no electrocardiogram changes were found .

The patient was followed with a repeat computerized tomography scan and was seen by the


Neurology Consult Service . The patient 's weakness did resolve . No further workup ensued at this point .
7,7 Disorder

Gastrointestinal - The patient was admitted with bloody diarrhea as described above .
7,8 Disorder

The workup above was undertaken and in addition further computerized tomography scans were obtained after the patient was transferred from the Medicine Intensive Care Unit to the General Medical Floor because of ongoing diarrhea .
33,33 Disorder

One of these abdominal computerized tomography scans revealed a small well circumscribed lesion in the pancreas .
12,12 Disorder

The patient 's lipase was elevated .
3,3,5,5 Disorder

The question was raised as to whether or not the patient may be experiencing pancreatitis and the patient was maintained on a BRAT diet , lipase levels declined .
14,14 Disorder|25,26 Disorder

It was felt that this may be contributing to the patient 's abdominal complaint .
12,13 Disorder

An abdominal ultrasound on [ * * 10 - 21** ] revealed no additional changes in this lesion .
17,17 Disorder

Eventually the patient 's diarrhea declined .
4,4 Disorder

1,3,15,15 Disorder|2,3,11,11 Disorder|6,6 Disorder

The distal right coronary artery was reconstituted with right - to - right collaterals with TIMI 1 flow .


There was successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the proximal to mid left anterior descending coronary artery , as well as thrombectomy with a final result of TIMI 3 flow .


Right heart catheterization was done as well showing elevated pressures with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 32 , a mean right atrial pressure of 22 mmHg .


PA pressure was 56 / 25 .


The cardiac index was depressed at 1 . 5 .
1,2 Disorder

Following catheterization the patient was transferred to the coronary care unit for further monitoring .


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Anxiety .
4,4 Disorder

PA pressure at that time was 33 / 14 .


Pertinent physical findings reveal that her sclerae were anicteric .


Her oropharynx was clear and dry .


Examination of the neck revealed jugular venous distension to the earlobes bilaterally .
5,7 Disorder

Her lungs had crackles at the left base but were otherwise clear .
3,3 Disorder

Her abdomen was obese , soft and nontender .
1,1,7,7 Disorder|1,1,3,3 Disorder

Her heart examination revealed a normal S1 and S2 , no murmurs were heard .

Coronary artery disease : The patient was status post anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction .
0,2 Disorder|9,13 Disorder

She was continued on aspirin after the procedure as well as Integrilin for 18 hours post catheterization .


She was started on Plavix to be continued for 30 days .


Immediately post catheterization because of her depressed cardiac output and index , her beta blocker and ACE inhibitors were held .
6,7,10,10 Disorder|6,8 Disorder

With these numbers the patient was not started on a statin .


Her beta blocker was titrated to 25 mg b . i . d . and was well tolerated .


B .


Rhythm : The patient was in sinus rhythm throughout her hospitalization .


On hospital day number to she was found to have an 11 - beat run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia .
16,18 Disorder

Electrophysiology was consulted regarding risk stratification in this woman peri - MI .
11,11 Disorder

It was felt that because of her very low ejection fraction and evidence for a large area of scarring by EKG that she should undergo risk stratification for arrhythmia , however it was felt that given that she had just completed an acute anterior myocardial infarction , it was felt that invasive electrophysiologic studies should be performed approximately one month after this admission .
7,10 Disorder|18,18 Disorder|28,28 Disorder|42,45 Disorder

25,27 Disorder|33,35 Disorder

She was diuresed with Lasix with improvement .


Because of her poor ejection fraction and anterior myocardial infarction the patient was anticoagulated initially with a heparin drip and Coumadin was begun .
3,5 Disorder|7,9 Disorder

Ultimately she was changed to Lovenox at the time of discharge until her warfarin with therapeutic .


Also for her heart failure the patient was placed on lisinopril 2 . 5 mg to be titrated as her blood pressure tolerated .

6,6 Disorder|11,11 Disorder|15,15 Disorder|19,19 Disorder|23,23 Disorder|27,29 Disorder|34,35 Disorder

Brief Hospital Course :


Pt was admitted on [ * * 2013 - 10 - 04** ] for the purpose of definitive surgical management of a chronic L kidney failure 2nd to ureteral calculi and L purulent perinephric psoas abcess .
22,22,24,25 Disorder|28,29 Disorder|34,35 Disorder

The planned L radical nephrectomy / ureterectomy was without complication or finding necessitating a change in the pre - operative diagnosis , but given her fragile health , large fluid shift and the 800cc of EBL ( addressed with 3U PRBC ) she was maintained in the PACU overnight .
9,9 Disorder

R nephrostomy tube remained in place and General Surgery was present during the case to assist with the lysis of extensive adheions of the abcess to surrounding structures .
24,24 Disorder

On POD#1 , it was decided to wean her off the vent ( SIMV ) , and she was taken to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 572** ] for immediate post - operative period .


She was given a 24 hour course of Vanco , and started on 7 days of Ceftazidine .


She was sucessfully extubated on POD#2 .


However at this same time , she was noted to be in A - Fib with an inappropriate pacemaker response and EP was consulted for a question of the PM failure to capture .
12,14 Disorder|17,19 Disorder|29,32 Disorder

The pacemaker was interrogated on [ * * 10 - 06** ] and its setting reprogrammed to VV1 60 .


Wide complex V - tach was noted on [ * * 10 - 07** ] and runs of NSVT were noted on [ * * 10 - 09** ] .
0,4 Disorder|18,18 Disorder

EP again interrogated the PM and considered it functioning well , but her digoxin level was 1 . 2 - 1 . 4 , above the optimum 0 . 8 which they felt could have been contributing to ventricular irritability .
38,39 Disorder

Thus her out - pt digoxin dose was halves in compensate for her change in renal fxn .


Similarly , lisinopril was also stopped post - operatively .


On POD#3 , pt was cleared by a Speech and Swallow Eval .


Pt was transferred to 12Reisman and out of the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 572** ] on POD#4 , with telemetry and a sitter .


Chest tube was removed on POD#3 , which was place as per standard procedure for a thoracoabdominal incision .


She was advance to a regular diet on POD#5 , and restarted on her home dose of warfarin .


Throughout the post - operative period until they were removed on POD#7 , her 2 JP drains put out > 100cc of serosanguinous fluid each .


Sitter was d / c'ed on POD#8 without incident ; pt remained agitated but cooperative .
12,12 Disorder

Pt was ready for discharge on POD#7 , but could not be discharged due to a sitter being involved in the pt 's care .


On POD#10 , pt had been without sitter for > 24 hours without incident , and had notably come back negative for both VRE and MRSA .

Brief Hospital Course :


78M with hx of AVR / CABG , s / p lung resection who presented to [ * * Hospital1 33** ] on [ * * 03 - 19** ] with confusion and found to have global aphasia s / p tPA for presumed stroke but no positive imaging who was initially given TPA and admitted to the ICU .
31,31 Disorder|36,37 Disorder|44,44 Disorder

He was then re - transfered to the ICU for acute bradycardia with hypotension and unresponsiveness .
11,11 Disorder|13,13 Disorder|15,15 Disorder

The bradycardia and hypotension was felt to be due to IV lopressor effect , and possibly due to pneumonia and sepsis .
1,1 Disorder|3,3 Disorder|18,18 Disorder|20,20 Disorder

An ABG at that time returned 6 . 94 / 151 / 101 and he was emergently intubated .


Femoral central access was obtained and he was transiently on Levophed for pressure support .


He was intubated from [ * * 03 - 25** ] - [ * * 03 - 28** ] , and his mental status then resolved after treating his hypercapnea and pneumonia .
22,23 Disorder|29,29 Disorder|31,31 Disorder

He was continued on a course of levaquin for staph aureus pneumonia , and his mental status remained stable .
9,11 Disorder|15,16 Disorder

He was re - evaluated by neurology after his mental status improved and was felt to have no focal neurologic deficits .
9,10 Disorder|19,20 Disorder

In fact , there was sufficient doubt as to whether or not he actually had a stroke on presentation since no evidence of a stroke was ever found .
16,16 Disorder|24,24 Disorder

His mental status changes may have been due to sepsis and respiratory failure - toxic / metabolic etiologies .
1,3 Disorder|9,9 Disorder|11,12 Disorder

For the 3 - 4 days prior to discharge his mental status remained clear and he continued to have improving swallowing function .
10,11 Disorder|20,21 Disorder

He completed a course of Levaquin for his penumonia , and he was afebrile .
8,8 Disorder|13,13 Disorder

His code status is DNR / DNI .

FINAL REPORT


PA AND LATERAL CHEST FROM [ * * 02 - 27** ]


HISTORY : Cholangitis and sepsis .
2,2 Disorder|4,4 Disorder

IMPRESSION : PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs :


Frontal view shows a second mediastinal contour parallel to the aortic knob bridged by a curvilinear calcification from the base of the arch .
5,6 Disorder|16,16 Disorder

This is likely to be a aortic aneurysm conceivably in association with dissection and , given the superior extent , probably involving the origin of head and neck vessels .
6,7 Disorder|12,12 Disorder

Elevation of the lateral aspect of the left hemidiaphragm and curvilinear infrahilar opacification of the left lower lung seen on the lateral view probably represent pleural parenchymal scarring .
0,0,8,8 Disorder|11,12 Disorder|26,27 Disorder

1,1,3,3 Disorder|9,9 Disorder

HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was evaluated in the emergency room and brought emergently to the operating room for an aortic dissection repair .
20,21 Disorder

Please see the OR report for full details .


In summary , the patient had an ascending aortic replacement with a # 28 Gelweave graft and an aortic valve resuspension .


Her bypass time was 137 minutes with a cross - clamp time of 90 minutes and a shock arrest of 27 minutes .


She tolerated the operation well and was transferred from to the operating room to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit .


At the time of transfer the patient was A paced at 88 beats per minute with a mean arterial pressure of 74 .


The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period .


Following an initial period of recovery the patient 's sedation was discontinued ; following which she did open her eyes and move both arms and legs ; however not to command .


With this , the patient became extremely hypertensive and therefore was re - sedated .
7,7 Disorder

Following this , the patient 's oxygen demand increased and therefore it was decided to keep the patient sedated for an additional day .


On postoperative day 2 , the patient removed hemodynamically stable ; on and off of Neo - Synephrine and nitroglycerin drips to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60 to 70 .


Additionally , the patient 's diuresis was begun .


It should be noted throughout this period that the patient had intermittent periods of atrial fibrillation , for which she was treated with amiodarone .
14,15 Disorder

On postoperative day 3 , the patient continued to have periods of atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response rate up to 150 ; for which she was cardioverted on numerous occasions .
12,13 Disorder|16,19 Disorder

She removed on an amiodarone drip and was also treated with small beta blockade .


On postoperative day 4 , the patient was more hemodynamically stable .


Her sedation was again discontinued .


Again , she was awake .


However did not follow commands , but we were able to successfully wean her ventilation .
3,4 Disorder

By postoperative day 5 , the patient was having less frequent periods of atrial fibrillation .
13,14 Disorder

She remained on amiodarone and beta blockade as well .


She was fully anticoagulated .


The patient was again on and off of Neo - Synephrine infusion to maintain an adequate blood pressure .


Neurologically she was awake , moving all extremities , and intermittently following commands .


She was weaned to CPAP on the ventilator ; however did not have the strength to be successfully extubated .


On postoperative days 6 and 7 , the patient was awake but still without strength to be successfully extubated .
13,14 Disorder

Therefore , she remained intubated during that period .


She was intermittently on Neo - Synephrine while she was having her episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation .
14,16 Disorder

During the opposing times she required Nipride and / or nitroglycerin to control her hypertensive episodes .
14,14 Disorder

On postoperative day 7 , the patient had a flow - by trial and was successfully extubated .


By postoperative day 8 , the patient was successfully weaned from all vasoactive IV medications and converted on to oral medications .


She remained in the ICU during that period because she continued to have some periods of atrial fibrillation .
16,17 Disorder

Additionally , she required vigorous pulmonary toilet .


For 2 additional days the patient remained in the ICU for pulmonary toilet .


She had no further episodes of atrial fibrillation .
6,7 Disorder

Additionally , on postoperative day 11 , the patient had a left - sided thoracentesis for approximately 600 cc of serosanguineous fluid .


Ultimately , the patient was transferred from the ICU to [ * * Wardname 3529**]Two on postoperative day 11 .


Once on the floor , the patient had a relatively uneventful postoperative course .


Ultimately , on postoperative day 13 , it was decided that the patient would be stable and ready for transfer to rehabilitation on the following day .


At the time of this dictation the patient 's physical exam is as follows : Temperature of 98 , heart rate of 81 ( sinus rhythm ) , blood pressure of 128 / 64 , respiratory rate of 24 , and O2 saturation of 93 % on 2 liters .

Cardiovascular : Patient presented with prior poor control of his hypertension .
10,10 Disorder

He was restarted on all of his regular antihypertensive medications including Lopressor , nifedipine , lisinopril , and clonidine , and for poor control of his blood pressure , hydralazine and labetalol prn were added .


As further history was gathered during his hospital stay indicated that the patient 's symptoms may have been preceded by micturition .
14,14 Disorder|20,20 Disorder

The possibility of an intracystic pheochromocytoma was considered despite the fact that the patient has had negative urine metanephrines in the past .
4,5 Disorder

To evaluate this possibility further , a MIBG scan was scheduled for the following week .


In preparation for this MIBG scan , the patient was weaned off his alpha and calcium - channel blockers as this was necessary for an accurate [ * * Location ( un ) 655** ] .


During this time , his blood pressure remained quite labile .
5,6,9,9 Disorder

The first labetalol and hydralazine were used for control , but after further episodes of poorly controlled hypertension , nitroglycerin IV drip was used as needed .
17,17 Disorder

Patient was transferred to the West Campus in preparation for this MIBG scan .


As his blood pressure continued to be quite labile , it was clear that closer monitoring and better control of his blood pressure was indicated , therefore the patient was transferred to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 44** ] on [ * * 12 - 01** ] , where a Nipride drip was started .
2,3,8,8 Disorder

Patient was weaned off all of his calcium - channel blockers , alpha blockers , and beta blockers in preparation for the MIBG scan , which occurred on [ * * 12 - 02** ] and [ * * 12 - 04** ] .

4 .


Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition : Patient was advanced slowly to his regular diet on admission after having a history of nausea and vomiting .
22,22 Disorder|24,24 Disorder

As his symptoms were thought to sometimes follow eating he was made NPO to evaluate this possible connection .
2,2 Disorder

During this time the patient received


PPN and then TPN and then nutrition consultation on [ * * 11 - 27** ] .


He resumed his regular diabetic diet .


IV fluids were often administered during his hospital stay to address increase in creatinine .


5 . Renal : Patient has a baseline creatinine of 1 . 7 to 1 . 9 .


During his hospital stay , his creatinine rose up to 2 . 6 .


IV fluids were administered to address this renal failure .

Service : [ * * Hospital Unit Name * * ]


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient is an 82 year old male who has apparently not sought medical care over 50 years , now being transferred from the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 32** ] after having family meetings and needing to be CMO .


Initially , the patient was admitted to an outside hospital on the [ * * 06 - 07** ] for increased confusion , lethargy and decreased PO intake times one to two weeks .
21,21 Disorder|23,23 Disorder|25,27 Disorder

On his initial evaluation at this outside hospital , he was found to have marked electrolyte abnormalities including hyperkalemia to 7 and azotemia with
15,16 Disorder|18,18 Disorder|22,22 Disorder

BUN of greater than 150 and creatinine of 10 .


He was initially treated aggressively for hyperkalemia with calcium , D50 and insulin and also bicarbonate and then subsequently transferred over to the [ * * Hospital * * ] for possible evaluation for hemodialysis .
6,6 Disorder

Here , at [ * * Hospital * * ] , the patient again was found to be hyperkalemic and uremic .
18,18 Disorder|20,20 Disorder

He was initially started on aggressive IV fluid resuscitation with bicarbonate .


An ABG was performed which was consistent with a metabolic acidosis .
9,10 Disorder

The patient was subsequently evaluated by the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 32** ] team , the Renal team and the Urology team .


He had minimal amounts of urine output .
5,6 Disorder

Subsequently , a renal ultrasound was done which showed bilateral hydronephrosis .
9,10 Disorder

He also had a bladder ultrasound which showed a large mass in the superior and posterior aspects of the bladder .
10,10 Disorder

The mass was presumed to be malignant .
1,1 Disorder|6,6 Disorder

There were initially several discussions with Renal and Urology for potential placement of either nephrostomy tubes or suprapubic catheters .


However , right after discussion with the patient 's family and the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 32** ] team , it was decided that the patient would not be interested in aggressive interventional treatment modalities that may not be able to cure an incurable disease .
45,46 Disorder

At this point , his code status was changed to DNR / DNI and specifically CMO with goal of comfort care only .
10,10 Disorder|12,12 Disorder

He was subsequently transferred from the ICU to the floor for this matter .


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : He had not seen an M . D . over 50 years , although apparently has had cataract surgery in the recent past .
21,21 Disorder

MEDICATIONS : None on admission or that he was taking as an outpatient . On transfer , he was on morphine prn and Ativan prn .


SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient reportedly lived alone .


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : The patient was found to be afebrile , slightly tachycardic to about 100 with blood pressures around 100 / 60 , breathing comfortably at 14 and 98 percent on room air .
9,9 Disorder|12,12 Disorder

In general , he was a cachectic , elderly male , mildly disoriented and confused but comfortable .
6,6 Disorder|12,12 Disorder|14,14 Disorder

HEENT exam was significant for markedly dry mucous membranes .
6,8 Disorder

His heart was tachycardic but regular .
3,3 Disorder

Lungs were clear at least with limited exam anteriorly .


Abdominal exam had mild diffuse lower abdominal tenderness .
5,7 Disorder

No masses were able to be appreciated .
1,1 Disorder

The lower extremities were negative for any edema .
1,2,7,7 Disorder

HOSPITAL COURSE : As mentioned above , the patient initially was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of acute renal failure with radiographic evidence to suggest there may be a post - obstructive component to his renal failure .
18,20 Disorder|30,32 Disorder|36,37 Disorder

He was also admitted with leukocytosis of unclear etiology .
5,5 Disorder

After discussions with the ICU , Renal and Urology teams and the patient 's family , it was decided that the patient would not want aggressive medical treatment .


Subsequently , the patient 's code status was changed to DNR / DNI and he was made CMO .
10,10 Disorder|12,12 Disorder

The family understands at this point that the patient 's main goal will be comfort .


To that end , he will be receiving morphine prn , Ativan and ________ prn .


He was allowed to take PO 's as tolerated .


His abdominal exam was unremarkable during his hospital course on the floor and he did not exhibit any evidence of significant pain from urinary retention .
21,21 Disorder|23,24 Disorder

Should this occur , one could consider possible suprapubic catheter placement for palliative purposes although this will need to be discussed with the family .


Meanwhile , discussions were held between Case Management and the patient 's family in regards to the optimum place for the patient to live the remainder of his life in a comfortable and dignified manner .


Currently , the patient is being planned for hospice placement .


Here , the patient will be treated with maximal amounts of comfort and care .


DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES : Acute renal failure , presumed post - obstructive .
3,5 Disorder|8,10 Disorder

Bladder mass , presumed to be malignant .
0,1 Disorder|6,6 Disorder

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS : Morphine sulfate prn , Ativan prn and ________ prn .

HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to Cardiac Surgery Service and appropriate preoperative workup was obtained .


Pulmonary consultation was obtained for this patient 's underlying pulmonary hypertension .
9,10 Disorder

They believe that this was in fact due to left ventricular failure and they recommended treating her failure including continued diuresis .
9,11 Disorder|17,17 Disorder

They also noted that she had no pulmonary contraindication to undergoing cardiac surgery .
8,8 Disorder

Therefore , on [ * * 2015 - 07 - 21** ] , the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times three .


She had saphenous vein graft to LAD , saphenous vein graft to OM , and saphenous vein graft to RCA .


Total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 75 minutes .


Cross clamp time was 41 minutes .


Postoperatively , the patient was taken intubated to the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit .


In the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit she was extubated on the evening of her operation and some of her pressors including Milrinone were weaned off .


The chest tubes were discontinued on the first postoperative day , as was the J - P drain left in her leg .


However , this ultimately required a total of six postoperative days in the Intensive Care Unit .


This was primarily for aggressive pulmonary toilet and for delirious mental status changes that responded well to Haldol p . r . n .
9,12 Disorder

During this time she was continued on her normal perioperative course of Vancomycin in addition , possible sources of her delirium were aggressively sought and non appeared to have been found .
20,20 Disorder

During all of the time the white count remained stable in the 10 to 12 region and the


BUN and creatinine were also stable .


By the 7th postoperative day , the patient was transferred our of Intensive Care onto the hospital floor .


On the floor , the Lopressor was sequentially increased to a final dose of 75 b . i . d .


In addition , the Lasix was converted from IV to a p . o . form as she continued to diurese and approached her preoperative weight .


In addition , the physical therapy team assessed her and noted her severe impairment and mobility .
13,13 Disorder|15,15 Disorder

They recommended rehabilitation upon discharge and felt that she had good potential for return to her prior level of functioning .


The patient had no other acute events during her hospitalization .
5,6 Disorder

It should be noted that the white blood cell count on the day prior to her transfer did climb from 11 to 15 .


However , on the day of her transfer it went back down to 12 .


During all this time , she remained afebrile .
7,7 Disorder

On [ * * 2015 - 07 - 29** ] , the patient was transferred to [ * * Hospital1 * * ]


TCU for further care .


It should be noted that her care originated at [ * * Hospital * * ] .


She is asked to followup with her primary care physician in approximately two weeks and to see Dr . [ * * First Name4 ( NamePattern1 ) * * ] [ * * Name Prefix ( Prefixes ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( Prefixes ) * * ] in approximately four weeks .


The patient is transferred on the following medications :


1 . Lasix 20 mg p . o . b . i . d .


2 . Potassium chloride 20 mEq p . o . b . i . d .


3 . Heparin 5000 subcutaneously b . i . d .


4 . Colace 100 mg p . o . b . i . d .

10 . Tylenol 650 mg p . o . q . 4h . to 6h . p . r . n .


11 . Sliding scale regular insulin .


Of note : Regarding the preoperative medications , we could not find a definitive indication for Plavix and have not yet restarted that , in addition to a likely need to have her


Norvasc , Diovan , and Lipitor restarted in the future , it is unclear whether or not she will continue to need the higher does of Lopressor or the higher dose of Lasix following her operation .


It is recommended that she be followed clinically .

She had lower extremity ultrasounds which were negative for deep vein thrombosis and chest x - ray showed right pleural effusion and cardiomegaly .
9,11 Disorder|19,20 Disorder|22,22 Disorder

When the patient 's INR decreased she was taken for a bronchoscopy which showed a pulsatile mass in the right middle lobe .
4,5 Disorder|16,16 Disorder

A biopsy and washings were performed .


After the procedure the patient did well until approximately 90 minutes later when she went into acute respiratory distress and respiratory failure .
16,18 Disorder|20,21 Disorder

She was intubated and brought to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 32** ] for further care .


On arrival to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 32** ] the patient was awake and appeared comfortable not in any distress .

SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient is a 35 - pack - year tobacco smoker who quit 12 years ago . No alcohol or drug use .


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission the patient was intubated but following commands .


Vital signs ; temperature 98 . 9 F , pulse 78 to 81 , blood pressure 89 to 97 over 36 to 69 .


The patient was having an oxygen saturation of 95 to 100 % on controlled ventilation .


Chest exam significant for decreased breath sounds on the right with coarse breath sounds and scattered rales anteriorly bilaterally .
4,6 Disorder|11,13 Disorder|16,16 Disorder

Heart exam significant for mechanical heart sounds .

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION TO [ * * Hospital Unit Name 32** ] : Complete blood count ; white blood cell count 9 . 8 , hematocrit 20 . 6 , platelet count 343 , 000 .


Coags significant for an INR of 1 . 4 .


Chemistry significant for bicarbonate of 38 , chloride of 91 .


Calcium was elevated at 11 . 6 .


Chest x - ray showed complete opacification of the right hemothorax and a large right atrium .
6,6 Disorder|10,10 Disorder|13,15 Disorder

Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at 80 to 85 beats per minute with right axis deviation and T - wave inversions in leads 2 , 3 and aVF with nonspecific ST changes .
2,3 Disorder|12,14 Disorder|16,19 Disorder|29,30 Disorder

HOSPITAL COURSE :


1 .


Right upper lobe mass .
3,3 Disorder

Due to the size and nature of the mass seen by x - ray and CT as well as bronchoscopy it most likely represented a malignancy .
8,8 Disorder|25,25 Disorder

However , the biopsy obtained during the bronchoscopy was not definitive .


Numerous sputum cytologies were sent which showed highly atypical keratinized squamous cells highly suspicious for non - small cell lung cancer .
15,20 Disorder

The patient was offered more definitive diagnostic modality such as a transthoracic CT guided needle biopsy ; however , she did decline due to the likelihood that this was malignancy .
29,29 Disorder

PTH related peptide was also sent as the patient was hypercalcemic and this showed that there was an elevated level of PTHrP which again made lung cancer the most likely and very likely diagnosis .
10,10 Disorder|25,26 Disorder

Both oncology , radiation oncology and CT surgery were consulted for recommendations on treatment options .


Radiation oncology felt that the mass was too large to receive radiation for treatment , however the patient could receive radiation for palliative reasons , perhaps to improve compression on large airways which may improve her respiratory function .

Therefore , the patient was taken for two doses of radiation , however , this did not resolve the insignificant improvement in any of her symptoms including her respiratory function .
25,25 Disorder|28,29 Disorder

Neither the oncology service nor the cardiac thoracic surgery service felt that there was any definitive treatment that could be done to significantly improve the patient 's mortality .


2 .


Respiratory failure .
0,1 Disorder

The patient 's respiratory failure was thought to be secondary to the large right lung mass as well as the copious amount of secretions that she was producing possibly secondary to the lung mass and combination of her underlying lung disease of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .

She was continued on mechanical ventilation for her entire Intensive Care Unit stay until the last day .


She was also given inhalers for bronchodilation for her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
9,12 Disorder

Numerous attempts were made to wean the patient from the ventilator .


Finally , it was decided since the patient had a terminal illness that the patient and the family both wanted to try extubation and spontaneous breathing .
10,11 Disorder

The patient was therefore extubated per her wishes .


Initially she did well but after approximately two hours the patient went into respiratory arrest and passed away .
13,14 Disorder

Prior to her extubation it was decided that were the patient go into respiratory arrest she would not be reintubated or resuscitated .

Cardiovascular .


The patient had a rate that appeared to be junctional while she was in the Intensive Care Unit .
4,4,9,9 Disorder

She was initiated on digoxin ; however , was taken off of this and her rate was well controlled .


She did not require any other nodal agents for rate control .


The patient was maintained on anticoagulation for an artifical valve .

PROCEDURE / FINDINGS : The procedure was performed by Drs . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 870** ] and [ * * Doctor Last Name 1015** ] , the attending radiologist , who was present and supervising throughout .


As no suitable superficial vein was present , the deep venous system of the right upper extremity was examined with ultrasound .


The right brachial vein was found to be patent and compressible .


The area was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion .


Local anesthesia with 2 cc of 1 % lidocaine was administered subcutaneously .


Using realtime ultrasound guidance , a 21 - gauge needle was advanced into the right brachial vein .


A hard copy ultrasound image before and after establishing puncture was obtained .


A 0 . 018 - inch guide wire was then advanced into the needle and into the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance .


The needle was then removed and exchanged for a 4 [ * * Ethnicity 23** ] introducer sheath .


Based upon the markers on the wire , the single lumen PICC was trimmed to length of 40 cm .


The PICC was then advanced through the sheath over the wire .


The wire and the peel - away sheath were removed .


A final fluoroscopic image demonstrates the tip of the catheter in the superior vena cava .


The lumen of the catheter was then flushed , aspirated , capped , and heplocked .


The catheter was fixed in place using a StatLock device , and a sterile dressing applied .


There were no immediate postprocedural complications .
4,5 Disorder

The line is ready for use .


IMPRESSION : Successful placement of a 40 cm long single lumen PICC via the right brachial vein terminating in the SVC using fluoroscopic and ultrasound guidance .

FINAL REPORT


HISTORY : 44 year old man with G tube and needs conversion to G - J tube for long - term feeding .


RADIOLOGISTS : Dr . [ * * First Name ( STitle ) 2833** ] [ * * Name ( STitle ) * * ] and Dr . [ * * First Name8 ( NamePattern2 ) 2834** ] [ * * Name ( STitle ) 273** ] performed the procedure .


Dr . [ * * Doctor Last Name 273** ] is present and supervising the procedure throughout .


PROCEDURE : Patient has a previous surgically placed 18 - [ * * Ethnicity 23** ] G tube .


A [ * * Doctor Last Name 273** ] wire is advanced through the G tube and the G tube is removed .


A 7 - [ * * Ethnicity 23** ] sheath is placed .


An H - 1 and then C2 catheter were used to engage the pylorus .


Using a glide wire and the C2 catheter , the wire and catheter were advanced into the proximal jejunum .


Contrast was injected , which demonstrated that the angle between the pylorus and duodenum is very acute .


Attempts were made to pass an Amplatz wire into the duodenum , however , due to the acute angle with the pylorus , this was not possible , and the Amplatz was exchanged for [ * * Initials ( NamePattern4 ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern4 ) 273** ] wire .


Over the [ * * Doctor Last Name 273** ] wire , an attempt was made to pass an 18 Fr .


G - J tube , however , the catheter would not pass without looping the wire in the stomach .


The Rosn wire was replced into the jejunum , and an attempt to place a 16Fr .


G - J tube was made .


Again , the wire would not support the catheter , and access to the Duodenum was lost .


Several attempts were then made to re - engage the pylorus , but these were unsuccessful .


Given that 60 minutes of fluoro time has been sued , a decision to replace An 18 - [ * * Ethnicity 23** ] Foley catheter was made , and the foley was replaced over a wire into the stomach , and balloon inflated with 5cc of saline .


The Foley catheter was secured to the skin .


The patient tolerated the procedure without immediate post procedure complication .


IMPRESSION : Unsuccessful attempt at placement of G - J tube due to the acute angle between the pylorus and the duodenum and the large size of catheter ( 18Fr ) required for the existing entry site .


It is Recommend to pursue endoscopic placement of G - J tube .


This was discussedw ith the house staff .

Brief Hospital Course :


Mr . [ * * lastname 2290** ] was initially kept strictly NPO due to his suspected aspiration pneumonia .
17,18 Disorder

He was treated with vancomycin and Zosyn for empiric coverage .


He was given supplemental oxygen via a face tent with standing nebulizer treatments .


In spite of his NPO status , he was having frequent episodes of intermittent hypoxia requiring suctioning of thick , tenacious secretions .
14,14 Disorder

This , in addition to serial CXRs revealed that he was clearly aspirating his secretions on a continuous basis in spite of his NPO status .
12,12 Disorder

Due to this as well as his baseline dementia , it was thought that putting in a PEG tube for nutrition would not solve the problem of aspiration since he was clearly unable to manage his own secretions .
8,8 Disorder|27,27 Disorder

Furthermore , it was clear that he would need constant restraints to avoid traumatic removal of a PEG , which was thought to be an unacceptable impairment in his quality of life .


In the setting of all of these issues and his severe , acute , worsening aspiration pneumonia , he was made comfort - measures - only by his family and legal guardian ; he was put on a morphine drip to help with his obvious discomfort , and he expired shortly thereafter .

Service : [ * * Hospital Unit Name 154** ] - [ * * Location ( un ) * * ] team


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : Mr . [ * * lastname 2761** ] was a pleasant 80 - year - old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease , hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , chronic lymphocytic leukemia , and hypogammaglobinemia , and liver and brain metastases with unknown primary , who was initially admitted with a brain metastatic bleed and resulting seizure disorder .
26,28 Disorder|30,30 Disorder|32,35 Disorder|37,39 Disorder|42,42 Disorder|45,45,48,48 Disorder|47,48 Disorder|50,51 Disorder|59,61 Disorder|64,65 Disorder

He was once admitted to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 154** ] from [ * * 10 - 22** ] to [ * * 10 - 23** ] for acute respiratory distress which was thought to be secondary to aspiration pneumonia and he was started on BIPAP and then weaned to face mask .
31,33 Disorder|41,42 Disorder

He was ruled in , also , for an MI with a peak troponin of greater than 50 .
9,9 Disorder

We were unable to treat him due to his metastatic bleed in his [ * * Last Name ( LF ) * * ] , [ * * First Name3 ( LF ) * * ] he was given aspirin and Lopressor .
9,10 Disorder

His aspiration pneumonia was treated with Zosyn , vancomycin , and Flagyl .
1,2 Disorder

He went to the floor on [ * * 10 - 23** ] and was started on hemodialysis .


However , the next day , he developed peripheral eosinophilia and urine eosinophilia which was thought to be secondary to his Zosyn and , so , he was changed to levofloxacin for one dose .
9,9 Disorder|12,12 Disorder

He also had his Quinton catheter pulled out which he was using for his hemodialysis on [ * * 10 - 25** ] because an AV fistula was formed and there was a big left groin hematoma with a drop in blood pressure .
25,26 Disorder|35,36 Disorder|39,42 Disorder

He also had a likely aspiration event on [ * * 10 - 26** ] with possible sepsis and the blood loss in his groin hematoma caused him to become hypotensive .
5,6 Disorder|17,17 Disorder|20,21 Disorder|24,25 Disorder|30,30 Disorder

He was also hypoxic and was found to be 88 % on room air .
3,3 Disorder

He was sent to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 154** ] and he was started on BIPAP , but intubated on [ * * 10 - 26** ] for airway protection .


He was continued on levofloxacin , Flagyl , and vancomycin for the presumed line sepsis and the aspiration pneumonia .
13,14 Disorder|17,18 Disorder

A lot of secretions were being suctioned out .


A CT angiogram was also done to rule out for PE , but that time , bilateral pleural effusions were found .
10,10 Disorder|16,18 Disorder

CT of the abdomen was unremarkable , except for polycystic kidney disease and liver metastasis .
9,11 Disorder|13,14 Disorder

The patient 's sputum grew MRSA and Serratia .
5,5 Disorder

He was being covered with vancomycin , Bactrim , and Ceptaz , but it was believed that his eosinophilia was secondary to his multiple drug interactions , and the patient also developed a drug rash in his axillary area which was also thought to be secondary to drug reaction .
18,18 Disorder|23,25 Disorder|33,34 Disorder|47,48 Disorder

In addition , the patient was still spiking temperatures and , at that time , it was concluded that it could be secondary to a drug fever due to the use of ceftriaxone .
7,8 Disorder|25,26 Disorder

Allergy and Immunology were consulted who recommended that all his antibiotics be stopped and the patient was started on tobramycin .


The patient was also receiving hemodialysis three times a week .


Despite all these multiple attempts for medical treatment , the patient did not show any signs of improvement .


The patient 's blood pressure was volatile / fluctuating up and down and the patient was repeatedly spiking temperatures .
3,4 Disorder|17,18 Disorder

At that time , a very detailed family meeting was held between the attending , Dr . [ * * First Name4 ( NamePattern1 ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern1 ) * * ] , the resident , Dr . [ * * First Name8 ( NamePattern2 ) 4884** ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern1 ) 1851** ] , social worker , and the daughter of Mr . [ * * lastname 2761** ] , [ * * First Name8 ( NamePattern2 ) * * ] [ * * lastname 2761** ] , who was actively involved in his care .


During the family meeting , it was decided that the patient will be made comfort measures only .


He will remain trached and we are going to continue some of his medications at this time and his tube feed and try to make him as comfortable as possible .


This was decided on [ * * 2009 - 11 - 09** ] .


On [ * * 2009 - 11 - 10** ] , it was decided that we could start slowly weaning off his medications , except for medications that would keep him comfortable .


All of his medications , including


Lopressor , aspirin , and other medications he was on , were all discharged and the patient was kept on an Ativan drip , Fentanyl drip , and his valproic acid to prevent him from developing any seizures .
37,37 Disorder

In addition , the antibiotics were also stopped because , on the family meeting of 9 / 23 , it was decided that the patient will not undergo any more hemodialysis and , since tobramycin was cleared by the kidney , all antibiotics were stopped .


The patient 's tube feeds were still continued , but they were decreased from 60 cc per hour to 10 cc per hour .


On [ * * 2009 - 11 - 11** ] , in the morning , it was decided that we could slowly start weaning off his trach and moving to pressure support of 5 , PEEP of 5 , FIO2 of 21 % , in a BIPAP mode and continue his tube feeds at 10 cc per hour and titrate up the Fentanyl and the Ativan as needed to make him more comfortable .


In addition , we can add a morphine drip and titrate that up , as well , as needed for comfort level .


On [ * * 2009 - 11 - 11** ] at 7 : 45 p . m . , the patient passed away .


The patient did not respond to sternal rub or any pain sensation .

At that time , the attending , Dr . [ * * First Name4 ( NamePattern1 ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern1 ) * * ] , was notified regarding the death of Mr . [ * * lastname 2761** ] .


In addition , his primary care physician , Dr . [ * * First Name4 ( NamePattern1 ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern1 ) 1703** ] , was also notified about his expiration .


In addition , his daughter , [ * * First Name8 ( NamePattern2 ) * * ] [ * * lastname 2761** ] , who was actively involved in his medical care , was also notified regarding her father 's death .


She refused any autopsy .

SHe was intially given ceftriaxone in the [ * * Doctor First Name 77** ] with vancomycin .


On admission to the floor , the ceftriaxone was stopped and the vancomycin was continued ( renally dosed ) .


Orthopaedics was consulted and took the patient to the OR on [ * * 2017 - 02 - 01** ] for incision and drainage of the left knee .


Significant pus was drained from the knee .


Cultures showed methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus .
2,5 Disorder

Infectious disease was consulted , who agreed with initial choice of antibiotics .


The only source of recurrent bacteremia identified was her pacemaker wires , which on TEE in October had fibrinous material noted .
5,5 Disorder

She had no other obvious source .


A repeat TTE was done on [ * * 2017 - 02 - 02** ] , which did not show evidence of endocarditis .
22,22 Disorder

Despite continued vancomycin therapy ( goal trough 15 - 20 ) , pt continued to have low grade fevers to 100 . 5 daily , and chest xray revealed a possible consolidation in the lower lobe .
16,18 Disorder|31,31 Disorder

Therefore , pt was started on levofloxacin in addition to vancomycin .


Pt was taken to OR on [ * * 2017 - 02 - 09** ] for pacer extraction by the electrophysiology service .


All anticoagulants except aspirin were discontinued prior to this date .


# Basilic vein thrombosis : On hospital day 7 , pt was noted to have upper extremity swelling in left > right , and vascular ultrasound revealed a thrombosis of the basilic vein .
3,3 Disorder|17,17 Disorder|28,28 Disorder

Despite this , anticoagulation was discontinued given the severe risks of anticoagulation in the setting of pacer extraction .
