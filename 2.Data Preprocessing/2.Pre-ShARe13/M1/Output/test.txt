HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS : Mr . [ * * lastname * * ] originally presented to an outside hospital on [ * * 07 - 15** ] with bright red blood per rectum , where he underwent a colonoscopy .
30,34 Disorder

This did not show any evidence of bleeding .
7,7 Disorder

He was sent home , but he was readmitted on the [ * * 07 - 17** ] with an increase in volume of stools , and he underwent a repeat colonoscopy at the outside hospital .
22,24 Disorder

He was again negative by colonoscopy and he was discharged home and he was hemodynamically stable .


On the [ * * 07 - 23** ] , he passed bowel movement and clots in large amounts to a total output of 1700 cubic centimeters .
11,11,15,15 Disorder|11,13 Disorder

He became hemodynamically stable and he was transferred to the [ * * Hospital 1026** ] , where he had a bleeding
21,21 Disorder

scan , EGD , upper GI series and a small bowel follow through .


All of these studies were negative .


He then underwent a bleeding scan at [ * * Hospital 1026** ] , which was negative for acute bleeding , but which showed pooling blood .
4,4 Disorder|18,19 Disorder|24,25 Disorder

He then underwent an angiography in an attempt to identify the bleeding vessels .
11,12 Disorder

Angiography was also undertaken to identify the bleeding vessel to guide surgical intervention and to attempt occlusion of the bleeding vessel .
7,8 Disorder|19,20 Disorder

At intervention radiology / angiography , the bleeding vessel was identified , however , attempted occlusion of this bleeding blood vessel was unsuccessful .
7,8 Disorder|18,20 Disorder

After being transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit , where Mr . [ * * lastname * * ] received numerous transfusion of packed red blood cells and crystalloid , Mr . [ * * lastname * * ] was prepared for surgery and underwent a subtotal colectomy on [ * * 2013 - 07 - 27** ] .


Intraoperatively , Mr . [ * * lastname * * ] received 7 . 2 liters crystalloid , had an estimated blood loss of 500 cc and urine output of 350 cc .


Incidental finding at the time of surgery was that Mr . [ * * lastname * * ] was asplenic , presumably because his spleen had been removed at the time of his prior surgery for bleeding diverticula - a right hemicolectomy .
19,19 Disorder|36,37 Disorder

The procedure was without complication .
4,4 Disorder

The patient was transferred to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit in stable condition .


Mr . [ * * Name13 ( STitle ) 6879** ] past medical history was significant for diverticulosis with recurrent lower GI bleeding for which he was treated with a right hemicolectomy in [ * * 2009** ] at an outside hospital .
17,17 Disorder|20,22 Disorder

Past medical history also was significant for hypertension , glaucoma , rheumatic heart disease and hemorrhoids .

2 . Zestril .


3 . Timolol for his glaucoma .
5,5 Disorder

4 . Proton pump inhibitor , Protonix .


ALLERGIES : Mr . [ * * lastname * * ] had no known drug allergies .


Mr . [ * * Name13 ( STitle ) 6879** ] postoperative course was largely uneventful and characterized by a slow , but steady recovery from his surgery .


He followed a conservative postoperative regimen , which included post - surgical bowel rest , routine labs , and chemistries .


On postoperative day # 4 , a series of Lasix doses were started in an attempt to gently diurese the fluid that Mr . [ * * lastname * * ] had received during his surgery .


This was intended to augment the normal diuresis of third space fluid following his surgery .


As Mr . [ * * Name13 ( STitle ) 6879** ] abdomen remained distended , through postoperative day # 7 , he was started on total parenteral nutrition on that day and this continued until he was taking adequate nutrition PO .
12,12,14,14 Disorder

On postoperative day # 9 , Mr . [ * * lastname * * ] was started on a diet of clear liquids , which he tolerated fairly well .


But , he continued to have mild to moderate abdominal distention with minimal tenderness .
9,9,13,13 Disorder|9,10 Disorder

He was continued on a regimen of IV and then PO Lasix to continue his diuresis of fluids and the abdominal examination was followed serially until it was felt that he was tolerating the clear diet well and solid foods could be reintroduced .


On postoperative day # 11 , as Mr . [ * * lastname * * ] was being screened for discharge from the [ * * Hospital 1026** ] , it was noted that he continued to have an oxygen requirement , which he did not have prior to his admission to the hospital .


Portable chest x - ray taken at that time showed no pneumonia , but some suggestion of pulmonary edema .
11,11 Disorder|17,18 Disorder

More vigorous diuresis using Lasix ( Furosemide ) was started and by postoperative day # 12 , Mr . [ * * Name13 ( STitle ) 6879** ] room air oxygen saturation was 98 % .


He was discharged on postoperative day # 12 .


At the time of discharge , Mr . [ * * Name13 ( STitle ) 6879** ] condition was good .

Service : NEUROLOGY


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This is a 75 year - old man with a past medical history of cerebrovascular accident with residual right hemiparesis in [ * * 1998** ] as well as diabetes type 2 , coronary artery disease , status post catheterization in
19,20 Disorder|23,24 Disorder|34,36 Disorder|38,40 Disorder

[ * * 2011** ] with three vessel disease as well as cataracts , hyperlipidemia and bipolar disorder who is admitted to [ * * Hospital 20** ] on [ * * 2012 - 06 - 26** ] after he was found down in his home .
6,8 Disorder|12,12 Disorder|14,14 Disorder|16,17 Disorder|41,42 Disorder

He was diagnosed with a left basal ganglia intracranial hemorrhage likely arising from the caudate with large intraventricular extension on the left .
8,9 Disorder

He had subsequent hydrocephalus as well as an acute myocardial infarction with troponins going greater then 50 as well as rhabdomyolysis with a CK in the 10 , 000s .
3,3 Disorder|8,10 Disorder|20,20 Disorder

He was admitted to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit for closer blood pressure and neurologic monitoring .


It was felt early on as his decreased level of consciousness was profound he would need neurosurgical intervention with a right ventricular catheter .
7,10 Disorder

This was placed on [ * * 06 - 27** ] the day after admission .


After insertion the catheter continued to have 200 to 300 cc output a day of blood tinged fluid and his mental status seemed to improve .
20,21 Disorder

On admission he had low grade fevers 100 to 101 range with an increased white blood cell count of 90 . 5 .
4,6 Disorder|13,17 Disorder

Initial workup showed pneumonia with right upper lobe infiltrate and also a question of left lower lobe infiltrate .
3,3 Disorder|8,8 Disorder|17,17 Disorder

He was given Ancef initially for his drain on the first day , however , it was then changed to Levaquin as well as Flagyl in light of his cultures came back .


He required intubation on [ * * 06 - 30** ] .


He was later started on Vancomycin with cultures coming back as heavy growth MRSA .
13,13 Disorder

He was followed closely in the Neurosurgical Intensive Care


Unit , the Neurology , Neurosurgery and the CICU medical team .


He continued to recover from his myocardial infarction and his enzymes trended down .
6,7 Disorder

His neurological deficits remained significantly unchanged .
1,2 Disorder

He was in the Intensive Care Unit with cerebral spinal fluid samples taken on [ * * 06 - 30** ] , [ * * 07 - 02** ] and


[ * * 07 - 06** ] , which were all no growth and the patient continued to have fevers even on broad spectrum antibiotics with a white blood cell count of 12 to 16 .
19,19 Disorder

He was briefly extubated , but then needed to be reintubated the same night .


His sputum continued to grow large amounts of MRSA on repeat cultures .
8,8 Disorder

His blood and urine culture were negative as well as cerebral spinal fluid .


Vancomycin was held briefly from [ * * 07 - 09** ] to [ * * 07 - 10** ] , however , the patient 's temperature again increased to 102 and repeat cerebral spinal fluid from ventricular drain at this point showed 3 + polys , 3 + gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters within the fluid with 4000 white blood cells and 110 polys and a glucose of 1 .
26,26 Disorder

Ceftazidime was added .


Infectious disease was consulted at that time .


His neurological examination continued to wax and wane .


His vent drain was raised and lowered depending on his arousal .


He was noted to have also right [ * * Hospital Unit Name 78** ] deviation and right twitching of his mouth on two separate occasions , which is suspicious for seizure .
18,18 Disorder|31,31 Disorder

We ordered an electroencephalogram which was abnormal due to low voltage slow background with bursts of polymorphic data and delta frequency slowing .


This indicated a wide spread cortical dysfunction as well as dysfunction of the deep midline structures as can be seen with severe encephalopathy .
5,6 Disorder|10,10 Disorder|22,22 Disorder

There were no focal epileptiform seizures seen .
4,5 Disorder

At that point we decided to watch him .


Later on in his course he had another episode where his eyes were strongly deviated to the right and we could not doll him pass the midline .
11,11,14,14 Disorder

At that point it was felt by the neuro team that we should treat him for seizures .
16,16 Disorder

We loaded him on phenytoin and gave him Ativan with good relief of his seizures .
14,14 Disorder

There was no need at that time to repeat an electroencephalogram as his clinical suspicion was high enough for epileptiform events .
19,20 Disorder

We decided to continue with our management and watch his blood pressure , heart rate and temperature .


He continued to spike .


We involved infectious disease who felt that this was fever meningismus and he was not following commands .
9,10 Disorder

There was concern for meningitis and this should be treated with Vancomycin .
4,4 Disorder

We continued that per their recommendations as well and continued Rifampin per their recommendations also .


He continued to not improve clinically and his neurological examination was somewhat limited .


He could follow simple commands intermittently , but could not move his right side to command .


He could occasionally squeeze hand , but not consistently .


He could not also consistently follow commands , but he would open his eyes to voice .


He was intubated and sedated .


His respiratory coarse breath sounds bilaterally , decreased breath sounds .
2,4 Disorder|7,9 Disorder

His cardiac examination was regular rate and rhythm .


We continued to watch him and watch his laboratories , however , he was unable to improve much .


Pulmonary critical care team felt he would benefit from a tracheostomy and this was planned until other issues medically kept him from this procedure .


It was felt he was on a downhill course and meningitis , which was being treated intrathecal Vancomycin by the neurosurgical service and that his hope for a meaningful recovery was somewhat less then originally due to many additional medical issues that worsened during his hospital admission .
10,10 Disorder|38,40 Disorder

It was felt by the team and by his responsible family that he would be best made CMO .


He was then made CMO and kept in the Intensive Care Unit for two days before being transferred to the floor .


He was given morphine for comfort as well as Ativan for respiratory distress .
11,12 Disorder

On [ * * 07 - 19** ] , he was found to be pulseless and not breathing and on examination he was pronounced expired at 7 : 00 p . m . on [ * * 07 - 19** ] .
14,14 Disorder|16,17 Disorder

His nephew [ * * First Name4 ( NamePattern1 ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern1 ) * * ] was called at his home and arrangements were to be made by him to the funeral home .

Brief Hospital Course :


Pt admitted to surgery from the [ * * Doctor First Name * * ] .


Ct showed :


1 .


Prominent loops of proximal small bowel adjacent to an omental fat containing ventral hernia with fecalization of bowel contents , adjacent inflammatory fat stranding , and small amount of fluid and extraluminal air consistent with bowel ischemia and contained perforation .
0,1 Disorder|12,13 Disorder|15,18 Disorder|21,23 Disorder|35,36 Disorder|39,39 Disorder

There also is apparent caliber change just below the level of the ventral hernia within the small bowel loops , as the distal loops of small bowel are markedly collapsed .
12,13 Disorder|29,29 Disorder

All these findings are suggestive of interval reduction of an incarcerated hernia with high - grade bowel obstruction .
10,11 Disorder|16,17 Disorder

At this time , no bowel loops are demonstrated within the ventral hernia .
5,6 Disorder|11,12 Disorder

2 . Patent mesenteric vessels .


3 . 2 , low - density lesions within the spleen , likely representing hemangiomas .
7,7 Disorder|14,14 Disorder

4 . Stable appearance of simple hepatic cyst within the dome of the liver .
6,7 Disorder

5 . Diffuse increase in density of the osseous structures consistent with renal osteodystrophy .
12,13 Disorder

6 .


Collateral vessels within the right lateral chest wall .


These findings are suggestive of a right subclavian vein stenosis .
7,9 Disorder

Clinical correlation is recommended .


Pt taken to the OR for operation .


Taken to the ICU intubated .


Renal consulted for HD and recs .


Pt extubated on POD1 .


Renal was consulted for continuation of her hemodialysis , which went on with out complication .
14,14 Disorder

She was kept NPO until bowel function resumed on POD 3 , She transferred out of the ICU once extubated on POD 1 .


She was kept on heparin gtt due to her need for anti - coagulation .


Once she had resumed POs , coumadin was started , and she was brought up to her normal coagulation level of 2 . 5 - 3 .


She will follow up in the coumadin clinic and hemodialysis for follwing her INR .


Through the remained of her postoperative course , she was advnced through sips , to clears , fulls , then to a regular diet which she tolerated well .


By POD 10 , she was tolerating regular diet , having bowel movements and her coumadin was theraputic .


She was d / c'ed home .

Brief Hospital Course :


Pt was admitted on [ * * 2013 - 10 - 04** ] for the purpose of definitive surgical management of a chronic L kidney failure 2nd to ureteral calculi and L purulent perinephric psoas abcess .
22,22,24,25 Disorder|28,29 Disorder|34,35 Disorder

The planned L radical nephrectomy / ureterectomy was without complication or finding necessitating a change in the pre - operative diagnosis , but given her fragile health , large fluid shift and the 800cc of EBL ( addressed with 3U PRBC ) she was maintained in the PACU overnight .
9,9 Disorder

R nephrostomy tube remained in place and General Surgery was present during the case to assist with the lysis of extensive adheions of the abcess to surrounding structures .
24,24 Disorder

On POD#1 , it was decided to wean her off the vent ( SIMV ) , and she was taken to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 572** ] for immediate post - operative period .


She was given a 24 hour course of Vanco , and started on 7 days of Ceftazidine .


She was sucessfully extubated on POD#2 .


However at this same time , she was noted to be in A - Fib with an inappropriate pacemaker response and EP was consulted for a question of the PM failure to capture .
12,14 Disorder|17,19 Disorder|29,32 Disorder

The pacemaker was interrogated on [ * * 10 - 06** ] and its setting reprogrammed to VV1 60 .


Wide complex V - tach was noted on [ * * 10 - 07** ] and runs of NSVT were noted on [ * * 10 - 09** ] .
0,4 Disorder|18,18 Disorder

EP again interrogated the PM and considered it functioning well , but her digoxin level was 1 . 2 - 1 . 4 , above the optimum 0 . 8 which they felt could have been contributing to ventricular irritability .
38,39 Disorder

Thus her out - pt digoxin dose was halves in compensate for her change in renal fxn .


Similarly , lisinopril was also stopped post - operatively .


On POD#3 , pt was cleared by a Speech and Swallow Eval .


Pt was transferred to 12Reisman and out of the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 572** ] on POD#4 , with telemetry and a sitter .


Chest tube was removed on POD#3 , which was place as per standard procedure for a thoracoabdominal incision .


She was advance to a regular diet on POD#5 , and restarted on her home dose of warfarin .


Throughout the post - operative period until they were removed on POD#7 , her 2 JP drains put out > 100cc of serosanguinous fluid each .


Sitter was d / c'ed on POD#8 without incident ; pt remained agitated but cooperative .
12,12 Disorder

Pt was ready for discharge on POD#7 , but could not be discharged due to a sitter being involved in the pt 's care .


On POD#10 , pt had been without sitter for > 24 hours without incident , and had notably come back negative for both VRE and MRSA .

1,1,3,3 Disorder|9,9 Disorder

HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was evaluated in the emergency room and brought emergently to the operating room for an aortic dissection repair .
20,21 Disorder

Please see the OR report for full details .


In summary , the patient had an ascending aortic replacement with a # 28 Gelweave graft and an aortic valve resuspension .


Her bypass time was 137 minutes with a cross - clamp time of 90 minutes and a shock arrest of 27 minutes .


She tolerated the operation well and was transferred from to the operating room to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit .


At the time of transfer the patient was A paced at 88 beats per minute with a mean arterial pressure of 74 .


The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period .


Following an initial period of recovery the patient 's sedation was discontinued ; following which she did open her eyes and move both arms and legs ; however not to command .


With this , the patient became extremely hypertensive and therefore was re - sedated .
7,7 Disorder

Following this , the patient 's oxygen demand increased and therefore it was decided to keep the patient sedated for an additional day .


On postoperative day 2 , the patient removed hemodynamically stable ; on and off of Neo - Synephrine and nitroglycerin drips to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60 to 70 .


Additionally , the patient 's diuresis was begun .


It should be noted throughout this period that the patient had intermittent periods of atrial fibrillation , for which she was treated with amiodarone .
14,15 Disorder

On postoperative day 3 , the patient continued to have periods of atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response rate up to 150 ; for which she was cardioverted on numerous occasions .
12,13 Disorder|16,19 Disorder

She removed on an amiodarone drip and was also treated with small beta blockade .


On postoperative day 4 , the patient was more hemodynamically stable .


Her sedation was again discontinued .


Again , she was awake .


However did not follow commands , but we were able to successfully wean her ventilation .
3,4 Disorder

By postoperative day 5 , the patient was having less frequent periods of atrial fibrillation .
13,14 Disorder

She remained on amiodarone and beta blockade as well .


She was fully anticoagulated .


The patient was again on and off of Neo - Synephrine infusion to maintain an adequate blood pressure .


Neurologically she was awake , moving all extremities , and intermittently following commands .


She was weaned to CPAP on the ventilator ; however did not have the strength to be successfully extubated .


On postoperative days 6 and 7 , the patient was awake but still without strength to be successfully extubated .
13,14 Disorder

Therefore , she remained intubated during that period .


She was intermittently on Neo - Synephrine while she was having her episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation .
14,16 Disorder

During the opposing times she required Nipride and / or nitroglycerin to control her hypertensive episodes .
14,14 Disorder

On postoperative day 7 , the patient had a flow - by trial and was successfully extubated .


By postoperative day 8 , the patient was successfully weaned from all vasoactive IV medications and converted on to oral medications .


She remained in the ICU during that period because she continued to have some periods of atrial fibrillation .
16,17 Disorder

Additionally , she required vigorous pulmonary toilet .


For 2 additional days the patient remained in the ICU for pulmonary toilet .


She had no further episodes of atrial fibrillation .
6,7 Disorder

Additionally , on postoperative day 11 , the patient had a left - sided thoracentesis for approximately 600 cc of serosanguineous fluid .


Ultimately , the patient was transferred from the ICU to [ * * Wardname 3529**]Two on postoperative day 11 .


Once on the floor , the patient had a relatively uneventful postoperative course .


Ultimately , on postoperative day 13 , it was decided that the patient would be stable and ready for transfer to rehabilitation on the following day .


At the time of this dictation the patient 's physical exam is as follows : Temperature of 98 , heart rate of 81 ( sinus rhythm ) , blood pressure of 128 / 64 , respiratory rate of 24 , and O2 saturation of 93 % on 2 liters .
24,25 Disorder

Weight at discharge was 79 kilograms ; preoperatively was 78 kilograms .


On physical exam , neurologically alert and oriented .


Moves all extremities .


Follows commands , although somewhat weak and lethargic .

The right groin catheterization site on arrival had no hematoma and peripherally the extremities are without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
9,9 Disorder|16,16 Disorder|18,18 Disorder|20,20 Disorder

HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to Cardiac Surgery Service and appropriate preoperative workup was obtained .


Pulmonary consultation was obtained for this patient 's underlying pulmonary hypertension .
9,10 Disorder

They believe that this was in fact due to left ventricular failure and they recommended treating her failure including continued diuresis .
9,11 Disorder|17,17 Disorder

They also noted that she had no pulmonary contraindication to undergoing cardiac surgery .
8,8 Disorder

Therefore , on [ * * 2015 - 07 - 21** ] , the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times three .


She had saphenous vein graft to LAD , saphenous vein graft to OM , and saphenous vein graft to RCA .


Total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 75 minutes .


Cross clamp time was 41 minutes .


Postoperatively , the patient was taken intubated to the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit .


In the Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit she was extubated on the evening of her operation and some of her pressors including Milrinone were weaned off .


The chest tubes were discontinued on the first postoperative day , as was the J - P drain left in her leg .


However , this ultimately required a total of six postoperative days in the Intensive Care Unit .


This was primarily for aggressive pulmonary toilet and for delirious mental status changes that responded well to Haldol p . r . n .
9,12 Disorder

During this time she was continued on her normal perioperative course of Vancomycin in addition , possible sources of her delirium were aggressively sought and non appeared to have been found .
20,20 Disorder

During all of the time the white count remained stable in the 10 to 12 region and the


BUN and creatinine were also stable .


By the 7th postoperative day , the patient was transferred our of Intensive Care onto the hospital floor .


On the floor , the Lopressor was sequentially increased to a final dose of 75 b . i . d .


In addition , the Lasix was converted from IV to a p . o . form as she continued to diurese and approached her preoperative weight .


In addition , the physical therapy team assessed her and noted her severe impairment and mobility .
13,13 Disorder|15,15 Disorder

They recommended rehabilitation upon discharge and felt that she had good potential for return to her prior level of functioning .


The patient had no other acute events during her hospitalization .
5,6 Disorder

It should be noted that the white blood cell count on the day prior to her transfer did climb from 11 to 15 .


However , on the day of her transfer it went back down to 12 .


During all this time , she remained afebrile .
7,7 Disorder

On [ * * 2015 - 07 - 29** ] , the patient was transferred to [ * * Hospital1 * * ]


TCU for further care .


It should be noted that her care originated at [ * * Hospital * * ] .


She is asked to followup with her primary care physician in approximately two weeks and to see Dr . [ * * First Name4 ( NamePattern1 ) * * ] [ * * Name Prefix ( Prefixes ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( Prefixes ) * * ] in approximately four weeks .


The patient is transferred on the following medications :


1 . Lasix 20 mg p . o . b . i . d .


2 . Potassium chloride 20 mEq p . o . b . i . d .


3 . Heparin 5000 subcutaneously b . i . d .

10 . Tylenol 650 mg p . o . q . 4h . to 6h . p . r . n .


11 . Sliding scale regular insulin .


Of note : Regarding the preoperative medications , we could not find a definitive indication for Plavix and have not yet restarted that , in addition to a likely need to have her


Norvasc , Diovan , and Lipitor restarted in the future , it is unclear whether or not she will continue to need the higher does of Lopressor or the higher dose of Lasix following her operation .


It is recommended that she be followed clinically .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient is a 62 - year - old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , coronary artery disease , mitral valve replacement and was found to have a right upper lobe mass on chest x - ray in [ * * 2012 - 04 - 03** ] .
19,22 Disorder|24,26 Disorder|40,40 Disorder

The patient had a follow - up chest CT scan which confirmed the presence of a mass in the right upper lobe and collapse of that lobe in [ * * 2012 - 10 - 03** ] .
16,16 Disorder|23,23 Disorder

Approximately four weeks prior to admission the patient is noted to have increased dyspnea on exertion and two weeks prior to admission the patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea on exertion and lower extremity edema .
13,15 Disorder|30,32 Disorder|34,36 Disorder

However , at that time she left against medical advise because she did not want to have a bronchoscopy or a thoracentesis done .
6,9 Disorder

The patient returned two weeks later on [ * * 02 - 02** ] with the same symptoms of shortness of breath , dyspnea , exertion and lower extremity edema .
19,21 Disorder|23,23 Disorder|27,29 Disorder

She also states she had a chronic cough and a 20 pound weight loss in the past year with one episode of hemoptysis .
6,7 Disorder|12,13 Disorder|22,22 Disorder

During the initial part of the hospitalization the patient 's Coumadin was discontinued .


She had lower extremity ultrasounds which were negative for deep vein thrombosis and chest x - ray showed right pleural effusion and cardiomegaly .
9,11 Disorder|19,20 Disorder|22,22 Disorder

When the patient 's INR decreased she was taken for a bronchoscopy which showed a pulsatile mass in the right middle lobe .
4,5 Disorder|16,16 Disorder

A biopsy and washings were performed .


After the procedure the patient did well until approximately 90 minutes later when she went into acute respiratory distress and respiratory failure .
16,18 Disorder|20,21 Disorder

She was intubated and brought to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 32** ] for further care .


On arrival to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 32** ] the patient was awake and appeared comfortable not in any distress .

10 . History of hepatitis .
4,4 Disorder

SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient is a 35 - pack - year tobacco smoker who quit 12 years ago . No alcohol or drug use .


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On admission the patient was intubated but following commands .


Vital signs ; temperature 98 . 9 F , pulse 78 to 81 , blood pressure 89 to 97 over 36 to 69 .


The patient was having an oxygen saturation of 95 to 100 % on controlled ventilation .


Chest exam significant for decreased breath sounds on the right with coarse breath sounds and scattered rales anteriorly bilaterally .
4,6 Disorder|11,13 Disorder|16,16 Disorder

Heart exam significant for mechanical heart sounds .
4,6 Disorder

Abdomen is benign .


Extremities show 1 + pitting edema bilaterally with no calf tenderness .
4,5 Disorder|10,10 Disorder

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION TO [ * * Hospital Unit Name 32** ] : Complete blood count ; white blood cell count 9 . 8 , hematocrit 20 . 6 , platelet count 343 , 000 .


Coags significant for an INR of 1 . 4 .


Chemistry significant for bicarbonate of 38 , chloride of 91 .


Calcium was elevated at 11 . 6 .


Chest x - ray showed complete opacification of the right hemothorax and a large right atrium .
6,6 Disorder|10,10 Disorder|13,15 Disorder

Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at 80 to 85 beats per minute with right axis deviation and T - wave inversions in leads 2 , 3 and aVF with nonspecific ST changes .
2,3 Disorder|12,14 Disorder|16,19 Disorder|29,30 Disorder

HOSPITAL COURSE :


1 .


Right upper lobe mass .
3,3 Disorder

Due to the size and nature of the mass seen by x - ray and CT as well as bronchoscopy it most likely represented a malignancy .
8,8 Disorder|25,25 Disorder

However , the biopsy obtained during the bronchoscopy was not definitive .


Numerous sputum cytologies were sent which showed highly atypical keratinized squamous cells highly suspicious for non - small cell lung cancer .
15,20 Disorder

The patient was offered more definitive diagnostic modality such as a transthoracic CT guided needle biopsy ; however , she did decline due to the likelihood that this was malignancy .
29,29 Disorder

PTH related peptide was also sent as the patient was hypercalcemic and this showed that there was an elevated level of PTHrP which again made lung cancer the most likely and very likely diagnosis .
10,10 Disorder|25,26 Disorder

Both oncology , radiation oncology and CT surgery were consulted for recommendations on treatment options .


Radiation oncology felt that the mass was too large to receive radiation for treatment , however the patient could receive radiation for palliative reasons , perhaps to improve compression on large airways which may improve her respiratory function .
5,5 Disorder|28,28 Disorder|36,37 Disorder

Therefore , the patient was taken for two doses of radiation , however , this did not resolve the insignificant improvement in any of her symptoms including her respiratory function .
25,25 Disorder|28,29 Disorder

Neither the oncology service nor the cardiac thoracic surgery service felt that there was any definitive treatment that could be done to significantly improve the patient 's mortality .


2 .


Respiratory failure .
0,1 Disorder

The patient 's respiratory failure was thought to be secondary to the large right lung mass as well as the copious amount of secretions that she was producing possibly secondary to the lung mass and combination of her underlying lung disease of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
3,4 Disorder|14,15 Disorder|20,23 Disorder|32,33 Disorder|39,40 Disorder|42,45 Disorder

She was continued on mechanical ventilation for her entire Intensive Care Unit stay until the last day .


She was also given inhalers for bronchodilation for her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
9,12 Disorder

Numerous attempts were made to wean the patient from the ventilator .


Finally , it was decided since the patient had a terminal illness that the patient and the family both wanted to try extubation and spontaneous breathing .
10,11 Disorder

The patient was therefore extubated per her wishes .


Initially she did well but after approximately two hours the patient went into respiratory arrest and passed away .
13,14 Disorder

Prior to her extubation it was decided that were the patient go into respiratory arrest she would not be reintubated or resuscitated .
13,14 Disorder

3 .


Cardiovascular .


The patient had a rate that appeared to be junctional while she was in the Intensive Care Unit .
4,4,9,9 Disorder

She was initiated on digoxin ; however , was taken off of this and her rate was well controlled .


She did not require any other nodal agents for rate control .


The patient was maintained on anticoagulation for an artifical valve .


Shortly after extubation the patient was found to be asystolic on Telemetry monitor . She passed away at 1 : 44 p . m . on [ * * 2013 - 02 - 21** ] .

Brief Hospital Course :


Mr . [ * * lastname 2290** ] was initially kept strictly NPO due to his suspected aspiration pneumonia .
17,18 Disorder

He was treated with vancomycin and Zosyn for empiric coverage .


He was given supplemental oxygen via a face tent with standing nebulizer treatments .


In spite of his NPO status , he was having frequent episodes of intermittent hypoxia requiring suctioning of thick , tenacious secretions .
14,14 Disorder

This , in addition to serial CXRs revealed that he was clearly aspirating his secretions on a continuous basis in spite of his NPO status .
12,12 Disorder

Due to this as well as his baseline dementia , it was thought that putting in a PEG tube for nutrition would not solve the problem of aspiration since he was clearly unable to manage his own secretions .
8,8 Disorder|27,27 Disorder

Furthermore , it was clear that he would need constant restraints to avoid traumatic removal of a PEG , which was thought to be an unacceptable impairment in his quality of life .


In the setting of all of these issues and his severe , acute , worsening aspiration pneumonia , he was made comfort - measures - only by his family and legal guardian ; he was put on a morphine drip to help with his obvious discomfort , and he expired shortly thereafter .
