2,2 Disorder|8,8 Disorder

After discussing with palliative care , the daughter requested continuing all non invasive medical care to see if there would be any improvement .


On [ * * 05 - 21** ] , the daughter requested a trial of tube feeds for 12 - 24 hours to see if this would improve the patient 's strength and ability to interact .


ON [ * * 05 - 22** ] she requested that the tube feeds be continued throughout the weekend .


Repeat CT [ * * 05 - 22** ] showed evolving infarct in the distribution seen on MRI , and no new processess .
11,11 Disorder|22,22 Disorder

A second EEG study [ * * 05 - 23** ] showed continued intermittent spike / waves from the area of the old infarct , but no epileptiform activity .
27,28 Disorder|22,23 Disorder

Her course was further complicated as she suffered an asystolic arrest on [ * * 2015 - 05 - 26** ] which was of unclear etiology but could relate to depressed mental status with resulting aspiration pneumonia / pneumonitis .

Coronary artery disease : The patient was status post anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction .
0,2 Disorder|9,13 Disorder

She was continued on aspirin after the procedure as well as Integrilin for 18 hours post catheterization .


She was started on Plavix to be continued for 30 days .


Immediately post catheterization because of her depressed cardiac output and index , her beta blocker and ACE inhibitors were held .
6,7,10,10 Disorder|6,8 Disorder

Eventually as her hemodynamics improved and her blood pressure tolerated , she was restarted on beta blocker , initially Lopressor 12 . 5 mg b . i . d .
3,3 Disorder

The patient was called out of the coronary care unit to the medical floor on the next hospital day , [ * * 2012 - 02 - 01** ] after the Swan - Ganz catheter had been discontinued .

With these numbers the patient was not started on a statin .


Her beta blocker was titrated to 25 mg b . i . d . and was well tolerated .


B .


Rhythm : The patient was in sinus rhythm throughout her hospitalization .


On hospital day number to she was found to have an 11 - beat run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia .
16,18 Disorder

Electrophysiology was consulted regarding risk stratification in this woman peri - MI .
11,11 Disorder

It was felt that because of her very low ejection fraction and evidence for a large area of scarring by EKG that she should undergo risk stratification for arrhythmia , however it was felt that given that she had just completed an acute anterior myocardial infarction , it was felt that invasive electrophysiologic studies should be performed approximately one month after this admission .
18,18 Disorder|28,28 Disorder|42,45 Disorder|7,10 Disorder

For that the patient will follow up with Dr . [ * * First Name4 ( NamePattern1 ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern1 ) 207** ] approximately one month after discharge .

There was symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy .
3,5 Disorder

There was severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with some preservation of the basal lateral and basal posterior wall segments .
6,6 Disorder

Overall however the left ventricular systolic function was severely depressed .
3,6,9,9 Disorder

On [ * * 2012 - 02 - 01** ] while being transfused for an hematocrit of 27 . 2 , the patient experienced some shortness of breath and clinical findings suggestive of congestive heart failure .
25,27 Disorder|33,35 Disorder

She was diuresed with Lasix with improvement .


Because of her poor ejection fraction and anterior myocardial infarction the patient was anticoagulated initially with a heparin drip and Coumadin was begun .
7,9 Disorder|3,5 Disorder

Ultimately she was changed to Lovenox at the time of discharge until her warfarin with therapeutic .


Also for her heart failure the patient was placed on lisinopril 2 . 5 mg to be titrated as her blood pressure tolerated .
3,4 Disorder

2 . Psychiatry : The patient was continued on her outpatient doses of Remeron and buspirone .


3 .


Urinary tract infection : Her urinalysis was checked on the evening of [ * * 2013 - 01 - 31** ] suggestive of urinary tract infection with leukocyte esterase , greater than 50 white blood cells , and many bacteria .
0,2 Disorder|23,25 Disorder

10,10 Disorder

Although partly obscured by motion on the prior study , this focus was not seen previously .


A tiny calcification in the left cental sulcus .
2,2 Disorder

In retrospect , this focus was probably present on the prior study .


There is no evidence of infarction , and there are no other areas of suspicion for hemorrhage .
5,5 Disorder|16,16 Disorder

Conclusion : Possible tiny focus of hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe , possibly an acute bleed .
6,6 Disorder|15,16 Disorder

This appears new since [ * * 2019 - 03 - 19** ] , but the prior scan was limited by motion .


There is a tiny calcification in the left central sulcus .
4,4 Disorder

No other evidence of hemorrhage or infarction .
6,6 Disorder|4,4 Disorder

There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension .
5,6 Disorder

No vegetation / mass is seen on the pulmonic valve .
1,1,8,9 Disorder|3,3 Disorder

There is no pericardial effusion .
3,4 Disorder

Compared with the findings of the prior report ( images unavailable for review ) of [ * * 2018 - 10 - 25** ] , probably no major change .


The absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis if clinically suggested .
4,4 Disorder|11,11 Disorder

US Carotids : 40 - 59 % right ICA stenosis . Less than 40 % left ICA stenosis
8,9 Disorder|16,17 Disorder

VIDEO SWALLOW [ * * 2019 - 04 - 03** ] :


Pt presents with a mild oral and pharyngeal dysphagia characterized by mildly reduced oral control , mild swallow delay and delayed laryngeal valve closure .
5,5,8,8 Disorder|7,8 Disorder|13,14 Disorder|17,18 Disorder|20,23 Disorder

The pt had one episode of trace aspiration when taking a larger sip of thin liquid .
7,7,14,15 Disorder

Aspiration was silent , but cued coughs were effective at clearing the aspirate material .
0,0 Disorder|6,6 Disorder|10,10,12,13 Disorder

The risk for trace aspiration was reduced by taking single , small sips of thin liquid .
3,4 Disorder

The pt was also noted to have increased oral control compared to the last videoswallow and is now able to tolerate a PO diet of thin liquids and soft consistency solids .
8,9 Disorder

Pt should only take single , small sips of thin liquid .


Pt was unable to swallow the barium tablet whole during the study , and should continue to have his pills crushed with purees .


RECOMMENDATIONS :


1 .


Suggest advancing to a PO diet of thin liquids and soft consistency solids . 2 .


Pt should only take single , small sips of thin liquid .


No Straws ! 3 .


Please crush all pills and give them with purees .


Brief Hospital Course :


78M with hx of AVR / CABG , s / p lung resection who presented to [ * * Hospital1 33** ] on [ * * 03 - 19** ] with confusion and found to have global aphasia s / p tPA for presumed stroke but no positive imaging who was initially given TPA and admitted to the ICU .
31,31 Disorder|36,37 Disorder|44,44 Disorder

He was then re - transfered to the ICU for acute bradycardia with hypotension and unresponsiveness .
11,11 Disorder|13,13 Disorder|15,15 Disorder

The bradycardia and hypotension was felt to be due to IV lopressor effect , and possibly due to pneumonia and sepsis .
1,1 Disorder|3,3 Disorder|18,18 Disorder|20,20 Disorder

An ABG at that time returned 6 . 94 / 151 / 101 and he was emergently intubated .


Femoral central access was obtained and he was transiently on Levophed for pressure support .


He was intubated from [ * * 03 - 25** ] - [ * * 03 - 28** ] , and his mental status then resolved after treating his hypercapnea and pneumonia .
22,23 Disorder|29,29 Disorder|31,31 Disorder

He was continued on a course of levaquin for staph aureus pneumonia , and his mental status remained stable .
9,11 Disorder|15,16 Disorder

He was re - evaluated by neurology after his mental status improved and was felt to have no focal neurologic deficits .
9,10 Disorder|19,20 Disorder

In fact , there was sufficient doubt as to whether or not he actually had a stroke on presentation since no evidence of a stroke was ever found .
16,16 Disorder|24,24 Disorder

His mental status changes may have been due to sepsis and respiratory failure - toxic / metabolic etiologies .
1,3 Disorder|11,12 Disorder|9,9 Disorder

For the 3 - 4 days prior to discharge his mental status remained clear and he continued to have improving swallowing function .
10,11 Disorder|20,21 Disorder

He completed a course of Levaquin for his penumonia , and he was afebrile .
8,8 Disorder|13,13 Disorder

His code status is DNR / DNI .

PA AND LATERAL CHEST FROM [ * * 02 - 27** ]


HISTORY : Cholangitis and sepsis .
2,2 Disorder|4,4 Disorder

IMPRESSION : PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs :


Frontal view shows a second mediastinal contour parallel to the aortic knob bridged by a curvilinear calcification from the base of the arch .
5,6 Disorder|16,16 Disorder

This is likely to be a aortic aneurysm conceivably in association with dissection and , given the superior extent , probably involving the origin of head and neck vessels .
12,12 Disorder|6,7 Disorder

Elevation of the lateral aspect of the left hemidiaphragm and curvilinear infrahilar opacification of the left lower lung seen on the lateral view probably represent pleural parenchymal scarring .

Electrolytes : Sodium 137 , potassium 4 . 4 , chloride 103 , bicarbonate 27 , BUN 33 , creatinine 1 . 6 , glucose 274 .


HOSPITAL COURSE :


1 .


Cardiovascular : Patient presented with prior poor control of his hypertension .
10,10 Disorder

He was restarted on all of his regular antihypertensive medications including Lopressor , nifedipine , lisinopril , and clonidine , and for poor control of his blood pressure , hydralazine and labetalol prn were added .


As further history was gathered during his hospital stay indicated that the patient 's symptoms may have been preceded by micturition .
20,20 Disorder|14,14 Disorder

The possibility of an intracystic pheochromocytoma was considered despite the fact that the patient has had negative urine metanephrines in the past .
4,5 Disorder

To evaluate this possibility further , a MIBG scan was scheduled for the following week .


In preparation for this MIBG scan , the patient was weaned off his alpha and calcium - channel blockers as this was necessary for an accurate [ * * Location ( un ) 655** ] .


During this time , his blood pressure remained quite labile .
5,6,9,9 Disorder

The first labetalol and hydralazine were used for control , but after further episodes of poorly controlled hypertension , nitroglycerin IV drip was used as needed .
17,17 Disorder

Patient was transferred to the West Campus in preparation for this MIBG scan .


As his blood pressure continued to be quite labile , it was clear that closer monitoring and better control of his blood pressure was indicated , therefore the patient was transferred to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 44** ] on [ * * 12 - 01** ] , where a Nipride drip was started .
2,3,8,8 Disorder

Patient was weaned off all of his calcium - channel blockers , alpha blockers , and beta blockers in preparation for the MIBG scan , which occurred on [ * * 12 - 02** ] and [ * * 12 - 04** ] .


Patient was transferred back to Medicine floor on [ * * 12 - 04** ] and on [ * * 12 - 05** ] , his blood pressure was well controlled on his regular oral antihypertensive regimen .


The results of the MIBG scan were pending at the time of discharge .


2 .


Endocrine : Patient has a history of type 1 diabetes .
7,9 Disorder

He was continued on his regular glargine dose with regular insulin - sliding scale to cover for elevated blood sugars , fingersticks continued q . i . d .
17,19 Disorder

3 .


Gastroparesis : When the patient was taking p . o . diet , he was continued on his regular regimen per treatment of his gastroparesis including erythromycin , Reglan , and famotidine , antiemetics including Zofran were also used to control intermittent nausea .
42,42 Disorder|24,24 Disorder|0,0 Disorder

4 .


Fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition : Patient was advanced slowly to his regular diet on admission after having a history of nausea and vomiting .
22,22 Disorder|24,24 Disorder

As his symptoms were thought to sometimes follow eating he was made NPO to evaluate this possible connection .
2,2 Disorder

During this time the patient received


PPN and then TPN and then nutrition consultation on [ * * 11 - 27** ] .


He resumed his regular diabetic diet .


IV fluids were often administered during his hospital stay to address increase in creatinine .


5 . Renal : Patient has a baseline creatinine of 1 . 7 to 1 . 9 .


During his hospital stay , his creatinine rose up to 2 . 6 .


IV fluids were administered to address this renal failure .
7,8 Disorder

Prerenal etiology was initially suspected but was not supported by FENa calculation as creatinine elevation was thought to be due to hypertensive and diabetic nephropathy .
0,1 Disorder|21,21,24,24 Disorder|23,24 Disorder

At the time of discharge , his creatinine had trended towards baseline .


6 . Intravenous access : Patient had a Port - A - Cath and a right IJ line placed during his hospital stay .


DISCHARGE CONDITION : Hemodynamically stable , afebrile with blood pressure well controlled on p . o . medications . Patient is asymptomatic .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient is an 82 year old male who has apparently not sought medical care over 50 years , now being transferred from the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 32** ] after having family meetings and needing to be CMO .


Initially , the patient was admitted to an outside hospital on the [ * * 06 - 07** ] for increased confusion , lethargy and decreased PO intake times one to two weeks .
21,21 Disorder|23,23 Disorder|25,27 Disorder

On his initial evaluation at this outside hospital , he was found to have marked electrolyte abnormalities including hyperkalemia to 7 and azotemia with
15,16 Disorder|18,18 Disorder|22,22 Disorder

BUN of greater than 150 and creatinine of 10 .


He was initially treated aggressively for hyperkalemia with calcium , D50 and insulin and also bicarbonate and then subsequently transferred over to the [ * * Hospital * * ] for possible evaluation for hemodialysis .
6,6 Disorder

Here , at [ * * Hospital * * ] , the patient again was found to be hyperkalemic and uremic .
18,18 Disorder|20,20 Disorder

He was initially started on aggressive IV fluid resuscitation with bicarbonate .


An ABG was performed which was consistent with a metabolic acidosis .
9,10 Disorder

The patient was subsequently evaluated by the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 32** ] team , the Renal team and the Urology team .


He had minimal amounts of urine output .
5,6 Disorder

Subsequently , a renal ultrasound was done which showed bilateral hydronephrosis .
9,10 Disorder

He also had a bladder ultrasound which showed a large mass in the superior and posterior aspects of the bladder .
10,10 Disorder

The mass was presumed to be malignant .
1,1 Disorder|6,6 Disorder

There were initially several discussions with Renal and Urology for potential placement of either nephrostomy tubes or suprapubic catheters .


However , right after discussion with the patient 's family and the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 32** ] team , it was decided that the patient would not be interested in aggressive interventional treatment modalities that may not be able to cure an incurable disease .
45,46 Disorder

At this point , his code status was changed to DNR / DNI and specifically CMO with goal of comfort care only .
10,10 Disorder|12,12 Disorder

He was subsequently transferred from the ICU to the floor for this matter .


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : He had not seen an M . D . over 50 years , although apparently has had cataract surgery in the recent past .
21,21 Disorder

MEDICATIONS : None on admission or that he was taking as an outpatient . On transfer , he was on morphine prn and Ativan prn .


SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient reportedly lived alone .


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : The patient was found to be afebrile , slightly tachycardic to about 100 with blood pressures around 100 / 60 , breathing comfortably at 14 and 98 percent on room air .
9,9 Disorder|12,12 Disorder

In general , he was a cachectic , elderly male , mildly disoriented and confused but comfortable .

5,7 Disorder

No masses were able to be appreciated .
1,1 Disorder

The lower extremities were negative for any edema .
1,2,7,7 Disorder

HOSPITAL COURSE : As mentioned above , the patient initially was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of acute renal failure with radiographic evidence to suggest there may be a post - obstructive component to his renal failure .
18,20 Disorder|36,37 Disorder|30,32 Disorder

He was also admitted with leukocytosis of unclear etiology .
5,5 Disorder

After discussions with the ICU , Renal and Urology teams and the patient 's family , it was decided that the patient would not want aggressive medical treatment .


Subsequently , the patient 's code status was changed to DNR / DNI and he was made CMO .
10,10 Disorder|12,12 Disorder

The family understands at this point that the patient 's main goal will be comfort .


To that end , he will be receiving morphine prn , Ativan and ________ prn .


He was allowed to take PO 's as tolerated .


His abdominal exam was unremarkable during his hospital course on the floor and he did not exhibit any evidence of significant pain from urinary retention .
21,21 Disorder|23,24 Disorder

Should this occur , one could consider possible suprapubic catheter placement for palliative purposes although this will need to be discussed with the family .


Meanwhile , discussions were held between Case Management and the patient 's family in regards to the optimum place for the patient to live the remainder of his life in a comfortable and dignified manner .


Currently , the patient is being planned for hospice placement .


Here , the patient will be treated with maximal amounts of comfort and care .

Pseudocyst - Jejunosotmy


J - tube Placement


History of Present Illness :


This 55 - year - old lady has a history of chronic alcoholic - induced pancreatitis .
11,15 Disorder

She has had a pseudocyst problem in the past that resolved over time and has previously had an open J tube placement in the last year for malnutrition during this period .
4,4 Disorder|27,27 Disorder

She recently presented with overt jaundice from bile duct obstruction and a history of many weeks of decline .
5,5 Disorder|7,9 Disorder

She has only lost 4 pounds over this period of time , but has been malnourished and unable to eat regular foods and has sustained herself only on liquids because of gastric outlet obstruction .
15,15 Disorder|31,33 Disorder

She was transferred to our care for assessment of her biliary obstruction and thoughts of therapeutic approaches to this and the large pseudocyst that was identified that was on the order of 10 x 10 cm in her mid - abdomen .
10,11 Disorder|22,22 Disorder

When we assessed her CAT scan , it was clear that she had three problems .


1 . Biliary obstruction from an obstructed bile duct .
2,3 Disorder|6,8 Disorder

2 . Gastric outlet obstruction from the duodenum being splayed across this large pseudocyst in the head of the pancreas .
2,4 Disorder|13,13 Disorder

3 . Sinistral hypertension from her pseudocyst as well .
6,6 Disorder|2,3 Disorder

It was clear that the whole upper abdomen was full of massive venous collaterals in that in fact the superior mesenteric vein drained into the splenic vein in order to drain her bowels .
12,13 Disorder

The interface between the lower aspect of the portal vein and the superior mesenteric vein was completely splayed out and attenuated and probably thrombosed by the pseudocyst mass effect .
23,23 Disorder|26,26 Disorder

With Dr . [ * * First Name ( STitle ) * * ] [ * * Name ( STitle ) 1453** ] , we decided that there was no value in any endoscopic approaches to either the pseudocyst or the biliary obstruction and it was clear that an operative approach was the safest and only way to approach this .

HISTORY : 44 year old man with G tube and needs conversion to G - J tube for long - term feeding .


RADIOLOGISTS : Dr . [ * * First Name ( STitle ) 2833** ] [ * * Name ( STitle ) * * ] and Dr . [ * * First Name8 ( NamePattern2 ) 2834** ] [ * * Name ( STitle ) 273** ] performed the procedure .


Dr . [ * * Doctor Last Name 273** ] is present and supervising the procedure throughout .


PROCEDURE : Patient has a previous surgically placed 18 - [ * * Ethnicity 23** ] G tube .


A [ * * Doctor Last Name 273** ] wire is advanced through the G tube and the G tube is removed .


A 7 - [ * * Ethnicity 23** ] sheath is placed .


An H - 1 and then C2 catheter were used to engage the pylorus .


Using a glide wire and the C2 catheter , the wire and catheter were advanced into the proximal jejunum .


Contrast was injected , which demonstrated that the angle between the pylorus and duodenum is very acute .


Attempts were made to pass an Amplatz wire into the duodenum , however , due to the acute angle with the pylorus , this was not possible , and the Amplatz was exchanged for [ * * Initials ( NamePattern4 ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern4 ) 273** ] wire .


Over the [ * * Doctor Last Name 273** ] wire , an attempt was made to pass an 18 Fr .


G - J tube , however , the catheter would not pass without looping the wire in the stomach .


The Rosn wire was replced into the jejunum , and an attempt to place a 16Fr .


G - J tube was made .


Again , the wire would not support the catheter , and access to the Duodenum was lost .


Several attempts were then made to re - engage the pylorus , but these were unsuccessful .


Given that 60 minutes of fluoro time has been sued , a decision to replace An 18 - [ * * Ethnicity 23** ] Foley catheter was made , and the foley was replaced over a wire into the stomach , and balloon inflated with 5cc of saline .


The Foley catheter was secured to the skin .


The patient tolerated the procedure without immediate post procedure complication .


IMPRESSION : Unsuccessful attempt at placement of G - J tube due to the acute angle between the pylorus and the duodenum and the large size of catheter ( 18Fr ) required for the existing entry site .


It is Recommend to pursue endoscopic placement of G - J tube .


This was discussedw ith the house staff .

Service : [ * * Hospital Unit Name 154** ] - [ * * Location ( un ) * * ] team


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : Mr . [ * * lastname 2761** ] was a pleasant 80 - year - old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease , hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , chronic lymphocytic leukemia , and hypogammaglobinemia , and liver and brain metastases with unknown primary , who was initially admitted with a brain metastatic bleed and resulting seizure disorder .
26,28 Disorder|30,30 Disorder|32,35 Disorder|37,39 Disorder|42,42 Disorder|45,45,48,48 Disorder|47,48 Disorder|50,51 Disorder|59,61 Disorder|64,65 Disorder

He was once admitted to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 154** ] from [ * * 10 - 22** ] to [ * * 10 - 23** ] for acute respiratory distress which was thought to be secondary to aspiration pneumonia and he was started on BIPAP and then weaned to face mask .
31,33 Disorder|41,42 Disorder

He was ruled in , also , for an MI with a peak troponin of greater than 50 .
9,9 Disorder

We were unable to treat him due to his metastatic bleed in his [ * * Last Name ( LF ) * * ] , [ * * First Name3 ( LF ) * * ] he was given aspirin and Lopressor .
9,10 Disorder

His aspiration pneumonia was treated with Zosyn , vancomycin , and Flagyl .
1,2 Disorder

He went to the floor on [ * * 10 - 23** ] and was started on hemodialysis .


However , the next day , he developed peripheral eosinophilia and urine eosinophilia which was thought to be secondary to his Zosyn and , so , he was changed to levofloxacin for one dose .
9,9 Disorder|12,12 Disorder

He also had his Quinton catheter pulled out which he was using for his hemodialysis on [ * * 10 - 25** ] because an AV fistula was formed and there was a big left groin hematoma with a drop in blood pressure .
25,26 Disorder|35,36 Disorder|39,42 Disorder

He also had a likely aspiration event on [ * * 10 - 26** ] with possible sepsis and the blood loss in his groin hematoma caused him to become hypotensive .
5,6 Disorder|17,17 Disorder|20,21 Disorder|24,25 Disorder|30,30 Disorder

He was also hypoxic and was found to be 88 % on room air .
3,3 Disorder

He was sent to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 154** ] and he was started on BIPAP , but intubated on [ * * 10 - 26** ] for airway protection .


He was continued on levofloxacin , Flagyl , and vancomycin for the presumed line sepsis and the aspiration pneumonia .
17,18 Disorder|13,14 Disorder

A lot of secretions were being suctioned out .


A CT angiogram was also done to rule out for PE , but that time , bilateral pleural effusions were found .
10,10 Disorder|16,18 Disorder

CT of the abdomen was unremarkable , except for polycystic kidney disease and liver metastasis .
9,11 Disorder|13,14 Disorder

The patient 's sputum grew MRSA and Serratia .
5,5 Disorder

He was being covered with vancomycin , Bactrim , and Ceptaz , but it was believed that his eosinophilia was secondary to his multiple drug interactions , and the patient also developed a drug rash in his axillary area which was also thought to be secondary to drug reaction .
18,18 Disorder|23,25 Disorder|33,34 Disorder|47,48 Disorder

In addition , the patient was still spiking temperatures and , at that time , it was concluded that it could be secondary to a drug fever due to the use of ceftriaxone .
7,8 Disorder|25,26 Disorder

Allergy and Immunology were consulted who recommended that all his antibiotics be stopped and the patient was started on tobramycin .


The patient was also receiving hemodialysis three times a week .


Despite all these multiple attempts for medical treatment , the patient did not show any signs of improvement .


The patient 's blood pressure was volatile / fluctuating up and down and the patient was repeatedly spiking temperatures .
3,4 Disorder|17,18 Disorder

At that time , a very detailed family meeting was held between the attending , Dr . [ * * First Name4 ( NamePattern1 ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern1 ) * * ] , the resident , Dr . [ * * First Name8 ( NamePattern2 ) 4884** ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern1 ) 1851** ] , social worker , and the daughter of Mr . [ * * lastname 2761** ] , [ * * First Name8 ( NamePattern2 ) * * ] [ * * lastname 2761** ] , who was actively involved in his care .


During the family meeting , it was decided that the patient will be made comfort measures only .


He will remain trached and we are going to continue some of his medications at this time and his tube feed and try to make him as comfortable as possible .


This was decided on [ * * 2009 - 11 - 09** ] .


On [ * * 2009 - 11 - 10** ] , it was decided that we could start slowly weaning off his medications , except for medications that would keep him comfortable .


All of his medications , including


Lopressor , aspirin , and other medications he was on , were all discharged and the patient was kept on an Ativan drip , Fentanyl drip , and his valproic acid to prevent him from developing any seizures .
37,37 Disorder

In addition , the antibiotics were also stopped because , on the family meeting of 9 / 23 , it was decided that the patient will not undergo any more hemodialysis and , since tobramycin was cleared by the kidney , all antibiotics were stopped .


The patient 's tube feeds were still continued , but they were decreased from 60 cc per hour to 10 cc per hour .


On [ * * 2009 - 11 - 11** ] , in the morning , it was decided that we could slowly start weaning off his trach and moving to pressure support of 5 , PEEP of 5 , FIO2 of 21 % , in a BIPAP mode and continue his tube feeds at 10 cc per hour and titrate up the Fentanyl and the Ativan as needed to make him more comfortable .


In addition , we can add a morphine drip and titrate that up , as well , as needed for comfort level .


On [ * * 2009 - 11 - 11** ] at 7 : 45 p . m . , the patient passed away .


The patient did not respond to sternal rub or any pain sensation .
6,7 Disorder|10,11 Disorder

Pupils were fixed and dilated and did not respond to any light .
0,0,2,2,4,4 Disorder|8,9,11,11 Disorder

No breath sounds were heard .
1,2 Disorder

No heart sounds were heard .
0,2 Disorder

At that time , the attending , Dr . [ * * First Name4 ( NamePattern1 ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern1 ) * * ] , was notified regarding the death of Mr . [ * * lastname 2761** ] .


In addition , his primary care physician , Dr . [ * * First Name4 ( NamePattern1 ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern1 ) 1703** ] , was also notified about his expiration .


In addition , his daughter , [ * * First Name8 ( NamePattern2 ) * * ] [ * * lastname 2761** ] , who was actively involved in his medical care , was also notified regarding her father 's death .


She refused any autopsy .
