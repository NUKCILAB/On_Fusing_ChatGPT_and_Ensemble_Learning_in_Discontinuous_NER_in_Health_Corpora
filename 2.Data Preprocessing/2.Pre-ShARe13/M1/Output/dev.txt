Therefore , on hospital day # 5 , the patient underwent a barium swallow , which revealed no extravasation of barium from the esophagus .
18,20 Disorder

At this point , the patient 's NG tube was discontinued , although he was kept NPO overnight .


TPN was continued and , therefore , on the next morning , hospital day # 6 , he was advanced to clears .


The patient tolerated the clears and on hospital day # 7 , the patient was advanced to regular diet .


He was tolerating a regular diet , therefore , the TPN and central line were discontinued .


The antibiotics were changed from IV Ampicillin , Gentamycin , and Flagyl to p . o .


Augmentin .


Of note : The patient 's hypertensive medication was increased from Lopressor 50 q . d . to 50 b . i . d .

10,11 Disorder|5,5,8,8 Disorder

HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was stabilized in the trauma bay , remained hemodynamically stable and after uncovering the extensive orthopedic injuries , she was taken to the Operating Room by the Orthopedic 's Team .
20,21 Disorder

At this time , the patient was also noted to have a significant perineal injury and the
13,14 Disorder

General Surgery and Colorectal Surgery teams were involved .


At that initial operating room intervention , the patient underwent multiple procedures which included incision and drainage of the right forearm , external fixation of the right forearm fractures , and IM rodding of the right femur .
27,28 Disorder

A perineal debridement followed by rectal washout and a diverting end - colostomy .


The patient tolerated all of these procedure well , remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the Trauma


Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring , ventilatory support and continued workup for injuries .
13,13 Disorder

The patient 's ensuing hospital course was significant for multiple trips to the Operating Room for debridement of her right thigh and buttock region .


There were multiple swab cultures taken and the patient was placed on the appropriate antibiotics .


She tolerated all of these procedures well and to facilitate the multiple trips to the Operating Room , the patient required ventilatory support and remained intubated during this period of time .


For sedation , she remained on narcotic and benzodiazepine drips which maintained her appropriate sedation levels .


On [ * * 2016 - 08 - 16** ] , while undergoing the debridement of the right buttock and thigh wound , underwent an ultrasound of the rectum which demonstrated an intact sphincter .
20,21 Disorder|18,18,21,21 Disorder

She also was noted at this time to have right purulent drainage from the right forearm where the external fixator had been placed and this was opened and debrided .
10,11 Disorder

Approximately a week after the initial injury and multiple debridements , Plastic Surgery was involved and after careful consideration it was considered for a VAC drain placement to allow the bed of tissue to granulate and look towards wound closure at some future point .
6,6 Disorder|38,38 Disorder

This was placed and she was continued on appropriate antibiotics .


Her nutrition was addressed with TPN initially and she was converted to tube feeds which she has tolerated .


Infectious Disease consultation was obtained .


Due to the extensive debridement of the right thigh and buttock region which was essentially down to the bone , the patient was diagnosed with osteomyelitis and she was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics which will be continued for an extensive period of time beyond this admission .
25,25 Disorder

Beginning on [ * * 2016 - 08 - 19** ] , the patient began to have temperature spikes and she was pan cultured .
17,18 Disorder

She was maintained on her broad spectrum antibiotics .


On [ * * 2016 - 08 - 24** ] , she was taken back to the Operating Room by the


Orthopedics Team where her right femur rod was removed and she had a replacement IM rod placed .


She had an echocardiogram which did not demonstrate any vegetations .
9,9 Disorder

After that orthopedic procedure , the patient actually defervesced . She was maintained on her antibiotic course .
8,8 Disorder

The VAC drains have been periodically changed every three to five days .


In early August , the patient was weaned to extubation which she has tolerated .


She was weaned off of her sedation which had resulted actually in high levels of narcotic and benzodiazepines .


In order to combat withdrawal , she was placed on an around the clock dose of Ativan to combat any tremulousness or withdrawal symptoms .
4,4 Disorder|20,20 Disorder|22,23 Disorder

On [ * * 2016 - 08 - 30** ] , the patient was taken to the Operating


Room with Plastic Surgery where she underwent a split - thickness skin graft taken from her left thigh donor site and placed on the right thigh and buttock area .


She tolerated this procedure well .


Post procedure , a VAC dressing was placed over the skin graft .


On [ * * 2016 - 09 - 01** ] , the patient was taken to the Operating


Room where she underwent an ORIF of the right forearm fracture .
9,10 Disorder

She tolerated this procedure well .


The right forearm VAC was placed .


The remainder of her stay in the ICU has remained stable .


She defervesced without any temperature spikes .
1,1 Disorder|4,5 Disorder

All of her recent cultures have been negative to date .


She continues on her broad spectrum antibiotics per Infectious Disease and will remain so for an approximate length of 12 weeks .


There are plans for Plastic Surgery to return to remove the buttock VAC to examine the skin graft .


Upon completion of the examination of the skin graft , the patient will be ready for discharge to rehabilitation to continue her likely long rehabilitation course .


She has actually done quite well despite the numerous and severity of her injuries .
13,13 Disorder

INDICATION : 56 - year - old man with frontotemporal dementia , status post seizure , pneumonia , and C . difficile , need for antibiotics .
14,14 Disorder|9,10 Disorder|16,16 Disorder|19,21 Disorder

PROCEDURE / FINDINGS : The procedure was performed by Drs . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 870** ] and [ * * Doctor Last Name 1015** ] , the attending radiologist , who was present and supervising throughout .


As no suitable superficial vein was present , the deep venous system of the right upper extremity was examined with ultrasound .


The right brachial vein was found to be patent and compressible .


The area was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion .


Local anesthesia with 2 cc of 1 % lidocaine was administered subcutaneously .


Using realtime ultrasound guidance , a 21 - gauge needle was advanced into the right brachial vein .


A hard copy ultrasound image before and after establishing puncture was obtained .


A 0 . 018 - inch guide wire was then advanced into the needle and into the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance .


The needle was then removed and exchanged for a 4 [ * * Ethnicity 23** ] introducer sheath .


Based upon the markers on the wire , the single lumen PICC was trimmed to length of 40 cm .


The PICC was then advanced through the sheath over the wire .


The wire and the peel - away sheath were removed .


A final fluoroscopic image demonstrates the tip of the catheter in the superior vena cava .


The lumen of the catheter was then flushed , aspirated , capped , and heplocked .


The catheter was fixed in place using a StatLock device , and a sterile dressing applied .


There were no immediate postprocedural complications .
4,5 Disorder

The line is ready for use .


IMPRESSION : Successful placement of a 40 cm long single lumen PICC via the right brachial vein terminating in the SVC using fluoroscopic and ultrasound guidance .
