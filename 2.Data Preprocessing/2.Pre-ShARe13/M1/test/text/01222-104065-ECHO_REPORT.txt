INTERPRETATION: 

Findings: 

LEFT VENTRICLE: Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed. There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. 

AORTIC VALVE: The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 

MITRAL VALVE: The mitral valve is not well seen. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. There is no significant mitral stenosis. Mitral regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. 

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality due to poor echo windows. The echocardiographic results were reviewed by telephone with the houseofficer caring for the patient. 

Conclusions: 
Technically suboptimal study. 
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Global and regional systolic function could not be adequately assessed. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve is not well seen. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Mitral regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified - ?mild. There is no obvious pericardial effusion. 

If the clinical suspicion for endocarditis is high, a TEE is suggested.
