History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**lastname **] is a 66 year old gentleman who awoke at 4AM on [**2012-03-13**] with 10/10 chest pain. Paramedics were called and he subsequently sustained a cardiac arrest. He was cardioverted for ventricular tachycardia, sedated and intubated and taken to the [**Hospital 6801**] [**Hospital3 **]. He was treated with aspirin, betablockade, aggrestat and heparin. Mr. [**lastname **] was urgently transferred to the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 346**] [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for a cardiac catheterization which revealed an 80% stenosed left main and a 50% stenosed left anterior descending artery. An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed for coronary perfusion and the cardiac surgical service was consulted for surgical revascularization.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM PERFORMED ON: [**2012-03-13**]  
Atrial activity is not clearly discernible. The rhythm appears to be atrial flutter with 3:1 A-V conduction at 90. Intraventricular conduction delay. Prior anteroseptal and lateral myocardial infarction. There is much baseline artifact. ST segment elevations in leads I, aVL and V4-V6 consistent with active anterolateral ischemia. Followup and clinical correlation are suggested.
No previous tracing available for comparison. 

[**2012-03-13**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM 
IMPRESSION: Severely depressed LV systolic function (LVEF 20-25%) with regional wall motion abnormalities c/w CAD. Normal RV systolic function. At least mild mitral and aortic regurgitation.  

[**2012-03-19**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild aortic regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2011-03-13**], global left ventricular systolic function is improved. Mild aortic regurgitation is also now seen.

[**2012-03-13**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION
1. Selective coronary arteriography of this right-dominant system revealed severe LMCA disease demonstrating an 80% distal stenosis. The LAD had a long 50% lesion involving the proximal and mid vessel as well as the D1 branch. The LCX and RCA were free of flow-limiting stenoses.
2. Hemodynamic evaluation after angiography revealed normal right-sided pressures (mean RA was 8 and RVEDP was 10 mmHg), moderately elevated left-sided pressures (mean PCW was 21 mmHg), and moderately elevated pulmonary pressures (PA was 43/18 mmHg). The cardiac index was supranormal at 6.9 L/min/m2 (on dopamine infusion, during 1:1 intra-aortic balloon counterpulsations, and using an assumed oxygen consumption).
3. An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed via the right femoral arteriotomy site with appropriate diastolic augmentation and systolic unloading.

[**2012-03-13**] CXR
1). An endotracheal tube terminates is slightly proximal in location. 
2). Pulmonary parenchymal opacity is present within the left lung base  obscuring the left hemidiaphragm with an associated small left-sided pleural effusion. 

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**lastname **] was admitted to the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 346**] [**Hospital **] Medical Center on [**2012-03-13**] for a cardiac catheterization. He was found to have an 80% stenosed left main and a 50% stenosed left anterior descending artery. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was placed for coronary perfusion and the cardiac surgical service was consulted for surgical evaluation. Mr. [**lastname **] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner and taken urgently to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to two vessels. Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. His IABP was weaned and removed on postoperative day one without complication. On postoperative day two, Mr. [**lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 740**] neurologically intact and was extubated. Amiodarone was continued for prevention of ventricular arrythmias. He was placed on a course of zosyn for thick, yellow bronchial secretions. On postoperative day three, he was transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit for further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. His epicardial pacing wires and drains were removed per protocol. The physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. Given his history of a ventricular tachycardia arrest and low ejection fraction, the electrophysiology service was consulted. A repeat echocardiogram revealed improvement in his left ventricular ejection fraction from 20% to roughly 35%. It was recommended to add betablockade and follow-up in 4-6 weeks with his cardiologist for a repeat echocardiogram with possible referral to the electrophysiology service for further testing. Mr. [**lastname **] continued to make steady progress and was discharged home on postoperative day six. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist and his primary care physician as an outpatient.
