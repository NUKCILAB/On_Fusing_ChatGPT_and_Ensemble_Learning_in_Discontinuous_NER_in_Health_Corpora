Pertinent Results:
Echo [**10-03**]: Prebypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated.  There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal(LVEF>55%). There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta. Epiaortic scan done to assess cannulation site on the ascending aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric and posteriorly directed. Post bypass: LV systolic function is mildly depressed. EF 45%. There is mild hypokinesia of the inferior wall. RV function is unchanged. There is bioprosthetic valve seen in the mitral posiiton. The valve appears well seated and the leaflets move well. There is mild MR [**First Name (Titles) 1955**] [**Last Name (Titles) 6773**] with the administration of protamine. There is a bioprosthetic valve seen in the aortic position. The valve appears well seated and the leaflets move well. Trace aortic insufficiency present.  CXR [**09-06**]: Comparison is made to [**2013-09-04**]. The patient is status post CABG and AVR and MVR. The cardiac silhouette, mediastinal and hilar contours appears stable. Bilateral small pleural effusions are again seen, slightly increased on the right in the interval. Again noted is left basilar discoid atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise clear. No consolidations are seen. There is no pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**lastname 6774**] [**Last Name (Titles) 902**] all pre-operative work-up as an outpatient. He was found to also have coronary artery disease and mitral valve disease. He was admitted one day prior to surgery secondary to being on Coumadin (which was stopped 5 days ago). He was started on heparin and usual lab work was performed. On [**09-02**] he was brought to the operating room where he underwent a aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement, and coronary artery bypass graft x 1. Please see operative report for surgical details. Surgery was uneventful and he was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Later on op day he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. By post-operative day one he was weaned off of any pressors. He was started on beta blockers and diuretics and was transferred to the SDU. He was gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight during his post-op course. On post-op day two his chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed. Coumadin was restarted for his chronic atrial fibrillation. Over the next several days his platelet count decreased but a HIT panel was negative. After this, post op day 5, he was started on low dose Heparin while awaiting his INR to increase with Coumadin. He remained stable over the next several days and worked with physical therapy for strength and mobility. His INR became therapeutic on post-op day eight and he was discharged home with VNA services and the appropriate follow-up appointments.
