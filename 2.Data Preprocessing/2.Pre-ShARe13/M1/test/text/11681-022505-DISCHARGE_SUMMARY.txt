Chief Complaint:
Right hemiparesis, dysarthria

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 87 year old right-handed female with past medical history of hypertension who presented as a transfer to our hospital for right-sided weakness after left pontine stroke.

Patient was in her usual state of health until Tuesday [**2016-10-04**]. 
She awoke that morning and found that her right side was weak when she was attempting to walk to the bathroom. She fell onto the bathroom floor and laid there for ~1 hour. No head injury or loss of consciousness status post fall. She made it back to her bed and went back to sleep. Later that morning, she called her daughter, who noted that her speech was slurred. At that point, she was taken to [**Hospital 4647**] in [**Location (un) 8190**].

While at [**Hospital 4647**], MRI reportedly showed a left pontine infarct and 2 small occipital lesions. She was started on 
Plavix. Carotid ultrasound showed no stenosis. Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 55%, trace mitral regurgitation and trace pulmonic insufficiency. As MRA showed a tight mid-portion basilar stenosis, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 189**] on [**2016-10-07**] for further
care.

She denies recent fevers, chills, headaches, visual changes like blurry or double vision, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, urinary frequency or incontinence. She denies parasthesias, incoordination, dizziness or vertigo.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**lastname 8191**] was admitted to the Neurology service with right hemiparesis and dysarthria. MRI/MRA revealed acute left pontine infarct, nonvisualization of right vertebral artery indicating occlusion, and high grade stenosis in the mid basilar artery. Echocardiogram provided no evidence for patent foramen ovale or a source of embolus. As her stroke was likely embolic in origin, she was started on coumadin and IV heparin. She continued to receive treatment for hypercholesterolemia. Her blood pressue during hospitalization was usually in the range of 140-160 systolic, 60-70 diastolic. Goal SBP as an putpatient was to be SBP: 120-130s, given her intracranial stenosis. She was seen by physical therapy, occupational therapy, and the speech consult services who all felt she would benefit from acute inpatient rehabilitation.

Clinically, Ms. [**lastname 8191**] improved during hospitalization. She regained some strength in her right upper extremity and her speech improved. She was determined to to be at high risk for aspiration and was started on a soft solid diet with nectar thick liquids. In the future, stroke Neurology clearance will be necessary to optimize care, in the event that she ever needs to undergo surgery or stop anticoagulation.
