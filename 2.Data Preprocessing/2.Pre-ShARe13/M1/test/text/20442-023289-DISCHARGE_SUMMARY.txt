[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 517**] [**Name (STitle) 224**] referred for an outpatient cardiac catheterization due to an abnormal stress echocardiogram.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In [**2011-12-02**], PTA with stenting,
[**2012-12-07**] diffuse instent restenosis of RSFA stent status post PTA of entire right SFA and a placement of a new stent.  On
[**2013-04-10**] status post left SFA stent placement and right SFA stent placement.  Patient has a history of a silent MI approximately seven years.  For 4-6 weeks prior to admission, he had been experiencing symptoms of heartburn with activity and anxiety.  A GI workup initially revealed a stomach polyp and an esophageal polyp, which was biopsied and found negative.  Dobutamine stress echocardiogram on [**2013-07-03**] was positive for chest pain and EKG changes.  Echocardiogram revealed an EF of 50 percent, posterior basilar akinesis, aortic sclerosis, no AI, thickened mitral valve, mild MR, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild-to-moderate TR, mild pulmonary hypertension, whose exercise imaging revealed mid to apical and inferior apical marked hypokinesis consistent with LAD stenosis.

Patient was then referred for cardiac catheterization, which he underwent on [**2013-07-08**].  The catheterization revealed normal left main with LAD 80 percent occlusion at the origin, 80 percent mid occlusion, left circumflex occluded after a large OM-1 with a 70 percent.  OM-2 fills by collaterals and RCA occluded.  At that time, the patient was referred for coronary artery bypass grafting by [**firstname **].
