Reason: please drain abdominal wall fluid collects (x 2) with ultras

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
45 year old woman with crohn's & Abdominal wall fluid collections on CT. 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please drain abdominal wall fluid collects (x 2) with ultrasound guidance 
ULTRASOUND DRAINAGE OF ANTERIOR ABDOMINAL WALL COLLECTION.

CLINICAL DETAILS: Background history of Crohn's disease. 
Collection in the deep subcutaneous tissues of the lower midline abdominal wall on outside CT.

PROCEDURE:

The patient's outside CT was reviewed for comparison. 
Preprocedure ultrasound images show a mainly anechoic (cystic) collection in the deep subcutaneous tissues of the lower midline abdominal wall, which measures up to 3.4 cm sagittal x 3 cm AP x 3.8 cm transverse. Some heterogenous hyperechoic material is noted within this mainly cystic collection.

Preprocedure written consent and confirmation of patient identity and nature of procedure was performed.

Following usual aseptic technique and local and intravenous analgesia, an 8- [**Ethnicity 665**] [**Last Name (un) 1981**] multipurpose pigtail catheter was advanced under realtime ultrasound guidance into this collection via a right paramedian approach. Aspiration yielded purulent material, a sample of which has been sent for microbiological analysis. The pigtail catheter was formed within this collection, which was then aspirated until empty yielding in total 24 cc of purulent material. No residual collection on the post-aspiration images. Catheter is held in place with a pigtail devise and stat-lock dressing.

No immediate complications. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (attending radiologist) was present.

Brief Hospital Course:
Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 27**] on [**2018-05-16**], the patient recieved Dilaudid  IV to help control pain and NS bolus to treat her hypotension 80/45mm Hg. The patient reported that her normal blood pressure tends to be on the low side. She was transfered to the ICU. She was made NPO, started on IVF and Ceftriaxone 1 gm IV q24h, empirically. She was then transfered to the floor. 

On [**2018-05-17**] she was advanced to a regular diet, her Dilaudid was changed to 1-2mg subcutaneous q4-6 prn, her abdomen remained red, warm and tender. An ultra sound guided pigtail catheter was placed. Aspiration yielded purulent material, a sample of which was for microbiological analysis. 

She remained stable with improved pain control. Her diet was advanced which she tolerated. Cultures from her abdominal wound returned Staph species sensitive to vancomycin. A PICC line was placed for iv antibiotics. Her drain put out scant amounts of reddish fluid and it was removed prior to her discharge without complication. She was out of bed, tolerating a regular diet and with adequate pain control. She was discharged to home with services and instructed to continue a 10 day course of vancomycin. She will follow up in clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
