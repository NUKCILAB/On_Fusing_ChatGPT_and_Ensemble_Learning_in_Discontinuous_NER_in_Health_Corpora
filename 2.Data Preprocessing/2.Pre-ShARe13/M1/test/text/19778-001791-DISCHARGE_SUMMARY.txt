Cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant sytem revealed  single vessel CAD. The RCA was a dominant vessel and was 95% occluded in  the mid vessel with thrombus. The RCA gave rise to a large PDA. The LMCA  was without angiographic evidence of flow limiting stenosis. teh LAD had  no angiographically apparent flow limiting stenosis and gave rise to a  large D1. The LCX had no angiographically visible flow limiting lesions  and gave rise to a large OM branch. 
2. Limited resting hmeodynamics revealed mildy elevated systemic 

pressures. 
3. Left ventriculography was deferred. 
4. Successful PCI of the proximal and mid RCA with two Cypher DES  (non-overlapping 3.5 x 18 mm), both post-dilated with a 4.5 mm balloon. 
5. Successful closure of the RFA arteriotomy site with a 6 [**Ethnicity 203**]  Angioseal device. 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Angiographic evidence of single vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Mildly elevated systemic pressures. 
3. Successful rescue PCI with stenting of the proximal and mid-RCA for  failed fibrinolytic therapy for acute inferior myocardial infarction.

EKG on Admission:
Sinus bradycardia. RSR' pattern in leads V1-V2. ST segment elevations in  leads II, III and aVF consistent with possible inferior ischemia/infarction.  

Follow Up EKG:
Normal sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block. Left anterior fascicular block. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2012-09-10**] the right bundle-branch block is new. There are also prominent T wave inversions in leads III and aVF with deep Q waves suggestive of inferior infarction/ischemia 

Brief Hospital Course:
51 yo male transferred from OSH with IMI. Lysed with full dose TNK, incompletely reperfused and still with pain on arrival at [**Hospital1 461**], taken to cath lab, had 95% RCA lesion which was stented with cyphers x 2. He had an uncomplicated recovery and was discharged pain free after three days on Toprol [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], lisinopril, and plavix.
