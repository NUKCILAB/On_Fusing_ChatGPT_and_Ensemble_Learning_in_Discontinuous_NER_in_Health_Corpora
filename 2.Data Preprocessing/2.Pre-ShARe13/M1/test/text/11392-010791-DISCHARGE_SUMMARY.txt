CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: S/P ASSAULT. ? BLEED.

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
52 year old man s/p assault GCS 7 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o bleed 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 52-year-old man status post assault, left intracranial hemorrhage.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect is identified. The ventricles are symmetric, and there is no shift of normally midline structures. The gray-white matter differentiation is preserved.

There is extensive soft tissue swelling overlying the left orbit in the area of known trauma. Additionally, there are fractures involving the lateral aspect of the left orbit and left maxillary sinus, and fluid can be seen within the left maxillary sinus. There is also opacification of several anterior ethmoid air cells along the medial wall of the orbit. This area is better evaluated on the dedicated CT scan of the sinuses performed the day. A small amount of fluid is seen within the sphenoid sinus. The middle ear cavities and mastoid air cells are well aerated.

IMPRESSION:

1. No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

2. Soft tissue swelling overlying the left orbit, along with fracture involving the left lateral orbital wall are better evaluated on the dedicated CT scan of the facial bones performed at the same time.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST

Reason: S/P ASSAULT. ? FX

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
52 year old man s/p assault GCS 7 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o fx 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 52-year-old man status post assault with a GCS of 7, evaluate for fracture.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images of the cervical spinal canal. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images.

CT C-SPINE: Patient is intubated and has an NG tube in place. There is no malalignment. No definite fractures are identified. There are degenerative changes at C3-4 with osteophytes narrowing the spinal canal and potential mildly indenting the spinal cord. At C4-5 a large osteophyte narrows the canal and the left neural foramen. It likely compresses the left side of the spinal cord. At C5-6 a large osteophyte narrows the spinal canal and likely compresses the cord. There is bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. An uncovertebral osteophyte narrows the left foramen at C6-7.

There is no significant prevertebral soft tissue swelling. CT is limited evaluation of intrathecal contents.

IMPRESSION: No fracture or malalignment. Degenerative changes are seen which result in narrowing of the spinal canal and neural foramina at multiple levels.

CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIA

Reason: S/P ASSAULT. ? FX

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
52 year old man s/p assault from the field. 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o fracture 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 52-year-old man with history of assault.

TECHNIQUE: Axial non-contrast images of paranasal sinuses were obtained.
Coronal reformatted images were prepared on a separate workstation.

SINUS CT: There are fractures of the medial, inferior, and lateral walls of the left orbit. There is fluid accumulation within the left maxillary sinus , frontal, sphenoid and ethmoid sinuses, with no other evidence of fracture within the bony walls of the sinus. The right maxillary sinus, right ethmoid sinus, and right frontal sinus have normal appearance. The cribriform plates are not equal in height. The anterior clinoid processes are not pneumatized. The nasal septum is in midline.

IMPRESSION:

1. Fracture of the medial, inferior, and lateral walls of left orbit.

2. Fluid accumulation within the sphenoid sinus, left maxillary sinus, left ethmoid sinus, and left frontal sinus with no other evidence of fractures within the bony plates of these sinuses.
