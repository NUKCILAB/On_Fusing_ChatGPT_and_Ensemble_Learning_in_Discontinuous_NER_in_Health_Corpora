Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 45 yo M with h/o polysubstance abuse admitted with EtOH intoxication.  

1.)  EtOH Intoxication with EtOH level of 317: The patient presented acutely intoxicated and was showing early evidence of tremulousness suspicious for alcohol withdrawal.  As the patient has a history consistent with very high risk for severe delerium tremens, he received a benzodiazepine load with valium and ativan.  He received a total of 350 mg of valium and 24 mg of ativan while in the ICU.  His vital signs remained stable without evidence of autonomic instability.  He received IVF with folate/thiamin/multivitamins. In collaboration with the psychiatry consult service, he was started on a low dose methadone taper to manage symptoms of opiate withdrawal as his dilated pupils were more consistent with this withdrawal syndrome as well.  He was recommended to be transferred directly to an inpatient detox program at the [**Hospital1 569**] VA.  However, he decided that he would leave against medical advice and pursue a detox program on his own.  It was explained to him multiple times by ICU staff, psychiatry staff, and social work staff that this was not in keeping with sound medical care as the health care staff was concerned that he would simply resume drinking upon leaving the hospital.  Furthermore, he was reminded that if he left, he would be homeless as there was no time to arrange housing.  He proceeded with leaving AMA.

2.) Depression with SI. He initially stated that he was trying to kill himself.  He was placed on a 1:1 supervision while he was intoxicated.  Upon becoming sober, he denied suicidal ideation.  The psychiatry consult evaluated him and confirmed that the patient was not actively suicidal.  He continued to receive lexapro at low dose.

3.) Atypical muscular skeletal movements:  The patient had periodic episodes of arm and leg moving.  These were evaluated by the neurology consult and thought to be not consistent with seizure and a low probability for a positive EEG.  No anti-convulsants were indicated.

4.) Chest pain:  The patient had a brief episode of chest pain in the left side of his chest.  This was not associated with diaphoresis or shortness of breath.  An EKG showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia and he had 3 sets of negative cardiac enzymes.  Upon discharge, it was recommended that he take a baby aspirin daily for primary cardiac prevention.

5.) Leukocytosis (WBC 14) likely stress response. No evidence of infection. The white count resolved on follow-up.

6.) Anemia: The patient had a normocytic anemia.  This developed after fluid resusistation.  There was no evidence of acute blood loss.  Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  The anemia could not be completely evaluated as the patient left AMA.  The anemia should be further evaluated as an outpatient.

7.) FEN. The patient received IVF with Thiamine, Folate, MVI in 1L of normal saline daily for 2 days. Replete lytes prn. Once he was sober, he tolerated a regular diet. 

8.) Heme positive stool. Iron studies were not consistent with iron deficiency. Will need [**Hospital1 85**] workup for occult blood loss.

9.) PPX. SC heparin, H2 blocker while not taking po's  

10.) Code: Full  

11.) Access: PIV  

12.) Dispo: patient left against medical advice. psychiatry consult confirmed that patient had capacity to make medical decisions once he was sober.

You were given medications to manage the alcohol withdrawal symptoms and a short course of methadone to manage opiate withdrawal.  These medications were not continued once you left the hospital.
