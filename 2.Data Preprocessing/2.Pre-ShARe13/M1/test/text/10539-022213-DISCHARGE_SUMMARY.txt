CXR ([**10-05**]) -- 1) Right internal jugular central venous line with tip at the superior vena cava/right atrial border. No pneumothorax. 2) Mild congestive heart failure. 

CT ([**10-09**]) -- IMPRESSION: 
1) Stable right UPJ and left distal ureter stones. Right nephrostomy tube  and no right hydronephrosis. 2) Extensive diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis. 3) Cholelithiasis. 4) Cardiomegaly. 5) Bilateral pleural effusions. 6) Probable hepatic cysts. 

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted on [**2013-10-04**] for the purpose of definitive surgical management of a chronic L kidney failure 2nd to ureteral calculi and L purulent perinephric psoas abcess.  The planned L radical nephrectomy/ureterectomy was without complication or finding necessitating a change in the pre-operative diagnosis, but given her fragile health, large fluid shift and the 800cc of EBL (addressed with 3U PRBC) she was maintained in the PACU overnight.  R nephrostomy tube remained in place and General Surgery was present during the case to assist with the lysis of extensive adheions of the abcess to surrounding structures.  On POD#1, it was decided to wean her off the vent (SIMV), and she was taken to the [**Hospital Unit Name 572**] for immediate post-operative period.  She was given a 24 hour course of Vanco, and started on 7 days of Ceftazidine.  She was sucessfully extubated on POD#2.  However at this same time, she was noted to be in A-Fib with an inappropriate pacemaker response and EP was consulted for a question of the PM failure to capture.  The pacemaker was interrogated on [**10-06**] and its setting reprogrammed to VV1 60. Wide complex V-tach was noted on [**10-07**] and runs of NSVT were noted on [**10-09**].  EP again interrogated the PM and considered it functioning well, but her digoxin level was 1.2-1.4, above the optimum 0.8 which they felt could have been contributing to ventricular irritability.  Thus her out-pt digoxin dose was halves in compensate for her change in renal fxn.  Similarly, lisinopril was also stopped post-operatively.  On POD#3, pt was cleared by a Speech and Swallow Eval.  Pt was transferred to 12Reisman and out of the [**Hospital Unit Name 572**] on POD#4, with telemetry and a sitter.  Chest tube was removed on POD#3, which was place as per standard procedure for a thoracoabdominal incision.  She was advance to a regular diet on POD#5, and restarted on her home dose of warfarin.  Throughout the post-operative period until they were removed on POD#7, her 2 JP drains put out >100cc of serosanguinous fluid each.  Sitter was d/c'ed on POD#8 without incident; pt remained agitated but cooperative.  Pt was ready for discharge on POD#7, but could not be discharged due to a sitter being involved in the pt's care.  On POD#10, pt had been without sitter for >24 hours without incident, and had notably come back negative for both VRE and MRSA.
