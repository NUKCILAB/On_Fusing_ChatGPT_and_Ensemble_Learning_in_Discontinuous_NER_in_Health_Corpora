Date of Birth:  [**1967-07-31**]             Sex:   F

Service: SURGERY

Allergies: 
Penicillins / Acetaminophen / Ultram / Oxycontin / Zantac / Levofloxacin

Attending:[**Attending Info 2957**] 
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions,
small bowel resection, primary repair of recurrent ventral hernia, placement of left femoral vein triple lumen central venous line, placement of PICC.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with end
stage renal disease on hemodialysis, status post epigastric ventral hernia repair in the distant past, who was noted recurrence of the ventral hernia but without any symptoms. The day PTA, during hemodialysis, she developed abdominal discomfort and nausea, and thereafter, severe pain at the side of the recurrent epigastric ventral hernia. She came to the emergency room where a CT scan of the abdomen revealed a small omental fat- containing ventral hernia above the umbilicus with mild adjacent inflammatory fat stranding. Adjacent to this region, there were multiple prominent loops of small bowel with fecalization of bowel contents and surrounding inflammatory fat stranding and fluid locally. The loops of bowel distal to these prominent loops appeared decompressed and the findings were suggestive of a recent reduction of an incarcerated hernia with high grade obstruction. She now presents for exploratory laparotomy.

Past Medical History:
1. Significant for end-stage renal disease secondary to glomerulonephritis possibly secondary to IgA diagnosed in
[**1996**], and the patient has been on hemodialysis since [**2001**]. She is anuric and is on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday dialysis schedule. 2. The patient has had bilateral below-the-knee amputations secondary to calciphylaxis in [**2011-04-15**] as well as multiple finger amputations during the same year. 3. She is status post a parathyroidectomy for previous admissions for hypercalcemia. 4. The patient is status post a left arteriovenous fistula on her left upper extremity placed in [**2010**], which became injured during a fistulogram in [**2013-06-15**]. 5. She has chronic pain. 6. She is status post a mitral valve replacement in [**2010-04-15**] with a mechanical Carbomedics 29-mm valve for rheumatic heart disease; and she is on Coumadin for this valve. She also has a history of endocarditis. 7. History of hypertension. 8. Anxiety.

The patient smokes one-third of a pack per
day. She denies any EtOH and is disabled.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted to surgery from the [**Doctor First Name **].  

Ct showed:
1. Prominent loops of proximal small bowel adjacent to an omental fat containing ventral hernia with fecalization of bowel contents, adjacent inflammatory fat stranding, and small amount of fluid and extraluminal air consistent with bowel ischemia and contained perforation. There also is apparent caliber change just below the level of the ventral hernia within the small bowel loops, as the distal loops of small bowel are markedly collapsed. All these findings are suggestive of interval reduction of an incarcerated hernia with high-grade bowel obstruction. At this time, no bowel loops are demonstrated within the ventral hernia.
2. Patent mesenteric vessels.
3. 2, low-density lesions within the spleen, likely representing hemangiomas.
4. Stable appearance of simple hepatic cyst within the dome of the liver.
5. Diffuse increase in density of the osseous structures consistent with renal osteodystrophy.
6. Collateral vessels within the right lateral chest wall. These findings are suggestive of a right subclavian vein stenosis. Clinical correlation is recommended.

Pt taken to the OR for operation.  Taken to the ICU intubated.  Renal consulted for HD and recs.  Pt extubated on POD1.  Renal was consulted for continuation of her hemodialysis, which went on with out complication.  She was kept NPO until bowel function resumed on POD 3, She transferred out of the ICU once extubated on POD 1.  She was kept on heparin gtt due to her need for anti-coagulation.  Once she had resumed POs, coumadin was started, and she was brought up to her normal coagulation level of 2.5-3.  She will follow up in the coumadin clinic and hemodialysis for follwing her INR.  Through the remained of her postoperative course, she was advnced through sips, to clears, fulls, then to a regular diet which she tolerated well.  By POD 10, she was tolerating regular diet, having bowel movements and her coumadin was theraputic.  She was d/c'ed home.
