Brief Hospital Course:
AP: 72 yo w/ ESRD on HD, CAD, HTN, asthma p/w significant hyperkalemia & associated arrythmias.  

# Hyperkalemia:  Pt arrived in the [**Doctor First Name 3**] with potassium of 8.4 (arterial).  Pt admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 221**], underwent HD with resolution of hyperkalemia.  The cause of the hyperkalemia was most likely due to inadequate/incomplete HD two days PTA.  Pt reportedly received abbreviated HD session two days PTA--his regularly scheduled HD day.  He reported no increased ingestion of K, nor any changes in his medications.  No clear evidence of hyperaldo.  The pt's K level remained stable after admission.  

# Dysrythmias: Pt has baseline conduction disease (RBB +/- fascicular blocks). On admission, he reportedly had bradycardic (junctional rhythm) to 20's.  Became hypotensive to SBP of 50/pulse.  He received atropine & epi.  Found to be hyperkalemic (8.4), which was likely the cause of his dysrythmias.  In [**Doctor First Name 3**], transcutaneous pacing attempted, but unsuccessful.  Went into wide-complex tachycardia w/ possible sine wave on EKG.  Pt intubated & put on pressors. Received emergent HD.  Pt extubated & weaned off pressors after 1 day.  No further dysrythmias (aside from pt's baseline) after his hyperkalemia was treated.

# CAD: not active at present.  Continued ASA and statin.  

# ESRD: History of polycystic kidney disease.  On HD on T,TH,Sat @ [**Hospital 5221**].  Renal consulted.  Pt to resume outpatient dialysis.

# Hypoxia: Patient was hypoxic on admission.  Patient was intubated while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 221**].  Cause of hypoxia unclear: possibly asthma exacerbation, question of COPD exacerbation (however, the pt does not have documented COPD, though he does have long smoking history).  No evidence of PNA.  Prior to discharge, pt was tolerating room air, and was discharged on inhalers. 

# HTN: not an active issue during hospitalization

# Anemia: Chronic anemia. Baseline thought to be in low 30's.  Mildly macrocytic. Hct in low 30's during stay.  Likely component of both anemia of chronic kidney disease & anemia of chronic disease.  Iron slightly low, ferritin elevated, TIBC low.  Vitamin B12 & folate normal.  

# Thrombocytopenia: pt's plts nearly [**01-07**] of that on admission. 
HIT antibody negative.  Possible component of splenic sequestration w/ enlarged liver.  

# Elevated CK: may have been due to falls prior to admission.  

# Elevated Aminotransferases: trending down. Likely due to polycystic liver disease.  

# FEN: Cardiac diet
