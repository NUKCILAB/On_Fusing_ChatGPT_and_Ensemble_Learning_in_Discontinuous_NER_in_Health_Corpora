INTERPRETATION: 

Findings: 

LEFT ATRIUM: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is elongated. 

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: The right atrium is mildly dilated. 

LEFT VENTRICLE: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 

RIGHT VENTRICLE: The right ventricular wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is normal. 

AORTA: The aortic root is normal in diameter. 

AORTIC VALVE: The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis. 

MITRAL VALVE: The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate mitral annular calcification. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. 

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) pulmonic regurgitation is seen. 

PERICARDIUM: There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded. 

GENERAL COMMENTS: Image quality was suboptimal. 

Conclusions: 
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is elongated. 
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is normal. 
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis. 
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. 
6.There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
