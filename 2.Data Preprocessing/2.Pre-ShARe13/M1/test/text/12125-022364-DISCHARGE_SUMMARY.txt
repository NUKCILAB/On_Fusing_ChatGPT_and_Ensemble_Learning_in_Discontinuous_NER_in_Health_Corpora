Chief Complaint:
SSCP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with stent placement

History of Present Illness:
64yo man with h/o CAD s/p multiple percutaneous interventions, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, who had SSCP 2wks PTA, was scheduled for ETT, had PND and palpitations on PM PTA, then NSVT on DOA during his ETT and was transferred to [**Hospital1 189**] for cath.  Pt's CAD history consists of angioplasty of OM1, OM2 in [**2002**], a crown stent placed in his LAD in [**2009**], a relook in [**2010**], and a cath in 
[**2011-07-23**] that showed EF 42%, OM1 99% stenosis, OM2 100% stenosis,  RCA 20-30% stenosis, LVEDP 12 mmHg, moderate global hypokinesis with LVEF 42%. No intervention done at that time.  

Patient was in his USOH until 2 weeks PTA, when he had SSCP while jogging on a treadmill that ended on its own, no associated symptoms, no N/V, radiations, no diaphoresis, [**05-02**] pain at worst.  
He went in to his ETT on AM of admit, started exercising and was stopped by the tech for NSVT of 3 beats. PCP transfer to [**Hospital1 189**] for cath. In cath, pt was found to have right dominant system, single vessel coronary artery disease, LMCA clear, LAD patent stent, LCX with TO of OM2 branch, filling via collaterals, RCA tortuous mid vessel 50 to 60% stenoses, LVEDP 14 mm Hg, LVEF 53%, no MR. Pressure wire was placed in mid-RCA with FFR 0.6 (>0.75 indicating restricted flow); during attempts at stent placement dissection occurred, pt had [**09-01**] "elephant sitting on my chest" pain; one stent was placed proximal to the lesion, Fentanyl given, IABP started, pain relieved, pt sent to CCU.

Brief Hospital Course:
64yo man with h/o CAD s/p multiple PCIs, HTN, hyperchol, who had SSCP 2wks PTA, was scheduled for ETT, had PND and palpitations on PM prior to study and NSVT during study, was transferred to [**Hospital1 189**] for cath.

1. Cardio
A. Coronaries: 
During pt's cath procedure, mid RCA 50-60% stenosis was encountered.  A pressure wire read an FFR of 0.69 after adenosine, 0.83 at rest.  An attempt was made to stent the lesion, but given the tortuous nature of the RCA a dissection of the artery occurred.  The patient then had [**09-01**] pain "like an elephant was sitting on [his] chest." He was given Fentanyl and a IABP for pain control and for increased flow to his coronaries. He was admitted to the CCU, and had a largely uneventful CCU course.  He was maintained on ASA 325mg qd,  Lipitor 80mg qd (for antiinflammatory properities the higher dose was used), IABP for two days.  CT [**Hospital Unit Name **] was emailed and made aware, though pt's dissection was managed medically without further evidence of CP, SOB, DOE, or PND.  Cardiac enzymes peaked on the DOA and trended down thereafter, without NSTEMI.

B. Pump: 
Pt was on an IABP initially for pain relief and to increase flow to the stented RCA in the tortuous artery.  An attempt was made to wean the pump 1d post cath that failed secondary to hypotension.  Another attempt to wean on Day 2 post cath was successful.  He started on metoprolol 25mg po bid on Day 3, but did not tolerate with HR in 40s, so was switched over to metoprolol 12.5mg po qd. He was also started on lisinopril 2.5mg po qd.

C. Rhythm: NSR, intially with multiple PVCs c/w reperfusion of myocardial tissue but then stabilizing in NSR without ectopy.

2. Renal: creatinine immediately post-procedure 0.7, bumped to 
1.1, likely [**02-23**] dye load

3. GI: GERD; was on Protonix as outpatient, which was continued in the hospital

4. [**Hospital Unit Name **]: hematuria noted after anticoagulation and foley placement; after the foley and the anticoag were d/c'd this issue resolved.

5. Heme: hct drop on admit but then stable around 37 and trending up, thought possibly from procedure and urinary loss

Lipitor 10mg qd
