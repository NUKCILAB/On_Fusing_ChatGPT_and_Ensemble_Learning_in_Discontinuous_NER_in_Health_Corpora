INTERPRETATION: 

Findings: 

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. 

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. 

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size. Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). 

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV wall thickness. Normal RV chamber size. Normal RV systolic function. 

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. 

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). 

MITRAL VALVE: Mild mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) MR. 

TRICUSPID VALVE: Physiologic TR. Indeterminate PA systolic pressure. 

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion. 

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality. 

Conclusions: 
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. 
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is normal. 
4. The aortic root is mildly dilated. 
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation present. 
6. Mild mitral valve thickness. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
7.The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.  8.There is no pericardial effusion.
