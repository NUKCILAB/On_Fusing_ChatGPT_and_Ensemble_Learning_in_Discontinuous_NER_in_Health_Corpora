Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**lastname 1382**] was admitted the morning of 4/27 and proceeded directly to the operating room.  He underwent a mitral valve repair with resection of the posterior leaflet with a 28 mm [**Doctor Last Name 1383**] band with Dr. [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3**].  Please see OP note for full details. He was successfully weened and extubated on his operative evening and was placed on a steroid taper with the help of endocrinology given his addisons disease. On postoperative day two he was transferred to the inpatient telemetry floor for ongoing management and rehabilitation.  On postoperative day four he had a burst of atrial fibrillation -- converted spontaneously and was noted to have a first degree AV-block.  Due to this AV block, his beta blockade was held.  On postoperative day five, with no furtehr episodes of afib but with elevated BP and HR, a low dose beta-blocker was added with no change in his AV block.  He also continued to be significantly edamatous, nearly 14 kg up from his pre-op weight and he was actively diureses with lasix. On postoperative days six and seven, we continued to diurese him heavily.  Endocrine also continued to follow with regards for his steroid taper.   On postoperative eight, he cleared physical therapy and was discahrged home with a visiting nurse to follow.
