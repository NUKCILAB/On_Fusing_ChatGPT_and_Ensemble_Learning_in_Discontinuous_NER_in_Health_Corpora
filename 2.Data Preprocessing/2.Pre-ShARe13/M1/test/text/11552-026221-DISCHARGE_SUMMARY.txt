Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred to the CCU because the cause of the patient's cardiac arrest was unclear. A TTE showed normal EF and a very small pericardial effusion with no signs of tamponade. A CTA was negative for PE and only showed small bilateral atelectasis and the known goiter. Tox screens were negative. A head CT showed global loss of gray-white differentiation, which was concerning for edema related to ischemia. The patient was started on mannitol. EEG showed frequent discharges c/w either non-convlusive status or periodic epileptiform discharges with suppression pattern. A pentobarb coma was initiated because of failure of dilantin and phenobarbitol to suppress this activity. Her care was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 32**] team given her normal CV status.

In consultation with neurology, the patient's prognosis for any meaningful recovery was deemed to be very poor. After several family meetings with members of the ICU team, her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 8995**], nurses, and social worker/case management, the decision was made by the family to withdraw care. Given the patient's wishes to be an organ donor, the patient received 30,000U of heparin IV at the time of extubation on [**2017-09-04**]. The patient expired at 1356 on [**2017-09-04**].
