PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.3, blood pressure 164/36, heart rate of 36, respirations 18, satting 98% on room air.  General:  This is a well appearing, elderly female in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light.  Oropharynx is clear.  Mucous membranes moist are moist.  Cardiovascular exam reveals regular rhythm but bradycardiac; normal S1, S2 with II-III/VI systolic murmur.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with good bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema; dorsalis pedis are 2+.

LABORATORY DATA:  EKG on admission reveals sinus rhythm at 70 with a right bundle branch block morphology than subsequent
EKG which revealed a 2:1 conduction with an atrial rate of 80 and a ventricular conducted rate of 40.

Laboratory values on admission:  White count 7.3, hematocrit 33, platelets 199, INR was 1.1, sodium was 142, potassium
3.9, creatinine was 1.1, CK was 87.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiac rhythm:  The patient presented with 2:1 heart block at rates faster than 75.  The patient had a conduction abnormality which seemed to originate in the HIS system rather than at the atrioventricular node.  The patient had a stable PR interval prior to the heart block.

In addition to this, the patient also converted to 1:1 conduction with carotid massage.  Patient remained stable overnight and was asymptomatic with a rate of 36 to 38.
Patient then went for Pacemaker Clinic pacemaker implantation and tolerated this procedure well.  Patient remained in stable paced rhythm at the time of discharge.

2.  Pump:  Patient has an unknown ejection fraction which will be further followed up as an outpatient.

3.  Urinary tract infection:  The patient had evidence of a urinary tract infection on admission, and therefore her
Amoxicillin was changed to Augmentin for further coverage.
This will be further followed by her primary care physician at the time of discharge.

DISPOSITION:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Atrioventricular conduction block.
