FINAL REPORT
AP CHEST 4:38 A.M. ON [**08-27**].

HISTORY:  On dialysis.  Respiratory failure.

IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**08-02**] and 24:

Moderate right pleural effusion has increased since [**08-22**], partially obscuring anatomic detail in the right lung but mild interstitial edema is probably present.  Leftward mediastinal shift _____ a function of right pleural effusion and substantial left lower lobe collapse, even though the latter appears to have improved since [**08-22**].  Cardiac silhouette is top normal size.  No pneumothorax.

Tracheostomy tube and a dual channel right internal jugular dialysis line are in standard placements.  No pneumothorax.
