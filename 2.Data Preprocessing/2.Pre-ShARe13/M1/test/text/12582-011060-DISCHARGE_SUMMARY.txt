CXR ([**2020-05-30**])
IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of chest with no evidence of radiopaque foreign body or pneumomediastinum. 

EGD ([**2020-05-30**])
Findings: Esophagus:  
Contents: Solid food mixed with fluid was seen impacted in the lower third of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. Due to risk of aspiration the endoscope was withdrawn and patient was intubated for airway protection. Repeat endoscopy showed large pieces of solid food in the distal esophagus. Several pieces of food material were successfully removed using a snare and [**Doctor Last Name **] net. Subsequently the GE junction was clearly visualized. The remiander of the food particles were gently pushed into the stomach lumen under direct endoscopic visualization. The stomach and duodenum appeared normal.  Retroflexion in the antrum showed a large paraesophageal hernia with food material in the hernia sac. Some of this material was suctioned successfully. The mucosa in the distal esophagus appeared pale and friable suggestive of possible ischemic changes. Additionally a torsion of the hernia sac could not be ruled out.  
Stomach: Normal stomach.  
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.  
Impression: Food in the lower third of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. (foreign body removal)   Pale and friable mucosa at the GE junction.Large paraesophageal hernia with possible torsion. Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum  

CXR ([**2020-05-31**])
IMPRESSION: Scarring versus atelectasis in right lung base. No acute process.

Barium swallow ([**2020-06-01**])
BARIUM ESOPHAGRAM: Esophagus demonstrates nonpropulsive tertiary contraction. A moderate axial hiatal hernia is present. Lower esophageal sphincter opens normally without evidence of achalasia. A 13-mm barium tablet passes freely through the esophagus without holdup. Small amount of gastroesophageal reflux was demonstrated during the exam.

IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with presbyesophagus. Moderate axial hiatal hernia.

Esophageal manometry ([**2020-06-02**]) [**Location (un) 478**] pending

1 Food Impaction s/p EGD evacuation: his typical presentation of food impaction symptoms.  risk factors ?achalasia (or other GI motility disorder) and HH hernia.  EGD yesterday again revealed food impaction and was pushed through into the stomachand evacuated, also with type III paraesophageal hernia with ? torsion.  Pt tolerated the procedure very well, and remained asymtomatic post procedure. He was started on PPI post EGD.  Surgery was consulted given concerns of infarction vs tortion of hernia, he underwent a UGI series and esophageal manometry test prior to discharge in preparation for potential surgery and will be evaluated this Thursday after discharge by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for possible surgery late this week.  He was started on clear liquid diet which he tolerated well, and he was to continue soft diet post discharge until he sees Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] this Thursday for surgical evaluation.
