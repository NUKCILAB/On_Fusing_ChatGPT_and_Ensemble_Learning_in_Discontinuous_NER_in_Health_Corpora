FINAL REPORT
HISTORY:  62-year-old man with SVC syndrome.

RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 779**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 77**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 77**], the Attending Radiologist, was present throughout the procedure.

FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and the left arm was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  There was in situ peripheral venous catheter Angiocath placed in the antecubital vein.  A 0.018 wire was advanced into the Angiocath and the Angiocath was exchanged for a 4.5 introducer sheath under flouroscopic guidance.  Appropriate length of the midline was measured for the tip to be positioned within the axillary vein. The PICC line was trimmed to the appropriate length and advanced over the 0.018 wire with the tip in the axillary vein.  The catheter was secured to the skin with StatLock and dressed with sterile dressing.

IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a midline via in situ peripheral venous line with the tip in the left axillary vein.
