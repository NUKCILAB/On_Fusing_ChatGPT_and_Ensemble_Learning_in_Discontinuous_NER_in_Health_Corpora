History of Present Illness:
22 yo male, h/o primitive neuroectodermal tumor with mets to brain and spine, transferred from [**Hospital1 **], initially in [**Hospital Unit Name 25**] and then transferred to the floor.  He was initially diagnosed with a thoracic gangliogliom /resected in [**2012**].  He had back pain in 2/04, seen at [**Company 1119**], and was found to have mets to brain and spine.  Biopsy at that time confirmed diagnosis of NET.  At this time, he had radiation to his spine (3600 cGy) with carboplatin as sensitizer.  He then had 6 cycles of cytoxan/vincristine as maintenance, followed by high dose chemo and stem cell tx 3 months ago.  MRI 3 months after this ([**2014-03-04**]) showed some enhancement along spine at C2, mid thoracic, and sacral lesion, consistent with metastatic disease.  MRI brain was neg for disease, and cytology on LP was negative.  He started temozolomide/oral etoposided [**2014-03-24**].  Most recent MRI showed new left frontal lobe lesion among other mets.

Most recently, he has been on multiple meds for pain, including Dilaudid, methadone, and he had recently had an increase in his decadron.  Thalidomide had also recently been started.  The weekend prior to admission, he had intermittent episodes of somnolence interrupted by completely lucid/alert moments.  On morning of admission, he was slurring speech, making grammatical errors.  He had a CT at [**Hospital **] (thought to have stable appearance).  His mental status partially improved after administration of Narcan.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 79**] [**Hospital Unit Name 25**] for an ICU bed.  

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 25**], his mental status continued to improve.  He was followed by neurology/neurosurgery.  Antibiotics were initially administered for ?meningitis (LP not performed), and it was felt that no emergent treatment was needed at this time.  Upon transfer to the floor, his mental status was improved but still not at baseline; he was still somnolent, drowsy, but with no new weakness, tingling, neurologic deficits.  He denies fevers/chills/stiff neck/photophobia/new urinary or bowel symptoms.  Plan is for transfer to [**Hospital1 **] if ICU bed is available vs. discharge home.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Delta MS: was likely in setting of oversedation from medications. He was on dilaudid, methadone, and had recently been started on thalidomide (which can cause somnolence).  His mental status improved after Narcan, was started empirically on broad spectrum antibiotics for ?meningitis; these were stopped, however, as he has no obvious signs of meningitis.  LP was deferred given thrombocytopenia. His mental status remained stable (although not at baseline according to family).  All sedating meds continued to be held, and he was discharged just on dilaudid for pain control.  He will follow up with his primary oncologist at [**Hospital 5753**] who will arrange for further pain management and treatment. 

2.  Neuroectodermal tumor: seen by neuro, neuroonc in-house; no treatment at this time.  As per his primary oncologist, will either be transferred back to [**Hospital1 **] or home tomorrow.  No worsening on MRI, no herniation or midline shift.  He had visual field cuts that were possibly new, but his neurologic exam remained stable while in-house.  Decadron was continued for possible cerebral edema.  His oncologist at [**Hospital1 **] (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]) will follow up with him after discharge for further management.  He will have also have ophthalmology follow up for formal visual field testing and management.

3.  Pancytopenia: likely related to chemotherapy, received 1  U PRBC in [**Hospital Unit Name 25**], no signs of active bleeding.  His ANC was 540 at time of discharge, and platelets/hematocrit were stably low.  He was kept on neutropenic precautions while in-house.

4.  Pain: dilaudid as needed for pain, and he was discharged on this medication.  He will follow up in the pain clinic at [**Hospital 267**] so that a better pain regimen can be determined (and oversedation can be avoided).

5.  Constipation: His aggressive outpatient bowel regimen was continued.

6.  Bladder function: Detrol was continued in-house.

7.  Dispo: He was discharged to home, to continue on Dilaudid for pain control.  He will follow up in 2 days at [**Hospital1 **] for further management.
