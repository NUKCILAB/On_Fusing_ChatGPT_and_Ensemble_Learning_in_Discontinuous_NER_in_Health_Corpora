HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for further surgical therapy of his recurrent rectal cancer.  In the operating room, the decision was made to proceed with abdominoperineal resection.  The patient seemed to tolerate the procedure well without complication.

Postoperatively, the patient was recovering nicely on bedrest until the morning of [**2015-12-10**], postoperative day number two.
The patient on postoperative day number two had some mental status changes and was initially somewhat lethargic and became agitated and intermittently violent.  The patient became disoriented although he was alert.  Initial workup including cardiac and metabolic workups proved to be negative.  The patient did have some crackles on physical examination throughout his lung fields.  After speaking with the family, the patient had a history of some altered mental status changes preceding a previous episode of pneumonia that he had had.  Working diagnosis at that time was pneumonia versus hospital psychosis.  The patient's mental status did not improve over the course of the following two days with some intermittent agitation.  The patient was medicated with Haldol and Ativan.  This had some success.

On the evening of postoperative day number four, the patient had an acute episode of respiratory distress and required intubation on the floor.  Subsequent to this, the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring and ventilatory management.  In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient did well and was extubated postoperative day number six.  The patient was empirically covered for a probable aspiration pneumonia with Levaquin, a seven day course.  The patient was transferred back to the floor on postoperative day number six.  His mental status was normal at that time.
Throughout the rest of his hospital course, the patient did quite well.  His diet was advanced as tolerated.  The patient was discharged on postoperative day number ten tolerating a regular diet and having regular ostomy output, good pain control on p.o. pain medications.
