INTERPRETATION: 

Findings: 

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2018-06-04**]. 

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. 

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Dilated IVC (>2,5cm) with <50% decrease during respiration (estimated RAP 16-20 mmHg). 

LEFT VENTRICLE: Severe symmetric LVH. Severely depressed LVEF. [Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] No resting LVOT gradient. 

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV hypertrophy. Dilated RV cavity. Severe global RV free wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic RV systolic function likely more depressed given the severity of TR]. 

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal ascending aorta diameter. 

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AR. 

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate (2+) MR. LV inflow pattern c/w restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated LA pressure. 

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate [2+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension. 

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen. 

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

Conclusions: 
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 16-20 mmHg. There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2018-06-04**], left ventricular systolic function appears more depressed.
