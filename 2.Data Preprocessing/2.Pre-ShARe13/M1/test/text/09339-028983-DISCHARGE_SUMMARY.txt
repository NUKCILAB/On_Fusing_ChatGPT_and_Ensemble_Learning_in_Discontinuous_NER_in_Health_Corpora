HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to cardiothoracic surgery.  Chest x-ray showed misaligned sternal wires.  His
Coumadin was discontinued and he was scheduled to go to the operating room upon correction of his INR.  On the [**04-01**] the patient was brought to the operating room where he underwent sternal debridement and reclosure.  The patient tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the operating room to the cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  He did well in the immediate postoperative area.
