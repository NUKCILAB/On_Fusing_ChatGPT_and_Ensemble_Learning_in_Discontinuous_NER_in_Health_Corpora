PCXR: FINDINGS: Consistent with the given history, an endotracheal tube is identified with the distal tip approximately 10 mm from the carina. There is upward retraction of the right hilum. There is a right apical opacity. There is suggestion of traction bronchiectasis. Left apical pleural thickening is also seen. There is opacity in the left perihilar and retrocardiac regions which may represent atelectasis, aspiration, or early developing pneumonia. No pneumothorax is evident. There is a markedly tortuous aorta. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Endotracheal tube placement as above. For optimal placement, consider retracting 2 cm. There are left perihilar and left retrocardiac opacities which may indicate aspiration, atelectasis, or early developing pneumonia.

NCHCT: FINDINGS: There is a large intraparenchymal hematoma centered within the right basal ganglia involving the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. This measures 7.6 x 5.1 cm in greatest dimension. There is considerable associated mass effect with complete effacement of the right lateral ventricle and temporal [**Doctor Last Name **]. Contralateral dilatation of the left lateral ventricle and occipital [**Doctor Last Name **] is consistent with "trapped ventricle." There is 1.7- cm leftward subfalcine shift. 
Subependymal blood is seen within the frontal [**Doctor Last Name **] of the left lateral ventricle. Layering interventricular blood is seen with both lateral ventricles. A clot extebds within the [**Last Name (un) 5644**] of right lateral ventricle. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is noted within the sulci of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. There is mild diffuse vasogenic cerebral edema. Blood is seen within effaced suprasellar, ambien, and basilar cisterns.  Effacement is indicative of transtentorial herniation. The temporal lobes abut the brainstem worrisome for impending uncal herniation. The foramen magnum is effaced. The overlying osseous structures are unremarkable. Air- fluid levels within the right maxillary and ethmoid sinuses are consistent with intubation. Foci of air are seen tracking within the right parapharyngeal space extending to the right mandible and posteriorly into the prevertebral space.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large intraparenchymal hematoma centered in the right basal ganglia exerting considerable mass effect and 1.7-cm leftward subfalcine shift. Effacement of the suprasellar and basilar cisterns is consistent with transtentorial hernation. The temporal lobes abut the brainstem worrisome for impending uncal herniation.
2. Subarachnoid hemorrhage, predominantly involving the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo woman with hx HTN, high chol, sz d/o who vomited and became unresponsive within minutes today while talking with family, found to have massive R hemisphere hemorrhage with shift of midline structures, mass effect at OSH ([**Hospital 5643**] Hosp. in [**Location (un) **]), intubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 16**] and found to have fixed pupils, trace R corneal only (absent L), negative OCR, trace gag, triple flexion to noxious stimuli in LE bilat, and extension to nox stim in UE bilat.  Repeat CT scan at [**Hospital1 **] shows impending herniation through the foramen magnum, and enlargement of hemorrhage.  She presented with BP in 250s systolic and HR in 50s upon arrival, not overbreathing the vent - suggestive of [**Location (un) 2864**] triad.  Within 1 hr of arrival, she has dropped BP in response to nipride gtt, to 60s systolic.  Have discussed dismal neurological prognosis with family given current exam, and they will discuss goals of care.  No neurosurgical intervention indicated.  In the mean time, will admit to neurology ICU for closer monitoring, and supportive care until family able to discuss further and speak with our attg.

Patient was admitted to neurology ICU and monitored closely.  Received mannitol 50 g now, then 25g q6h, monitoring osms and Na q6h.  Loaded with Dilantin 1000mg (for approx 50kg female) slowly, to prevent risk of dropping BP further and cardiac arrhythmia, then started 100mg q8h.  Monitored lytes, coags, cbc, cardiac enzymes.  Addressed code status and goals of care via further family discussions.

Met with family husband and daughter evening @11:50pm [**12-28**] and patient's code status was made Comfort Measures Only.  Confirmed with NeuroICU attending Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] and ICU resident Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  Patient was subsequently extubated and passed away overnight from respiratory failure.  Family was notified and declined autopsy.
