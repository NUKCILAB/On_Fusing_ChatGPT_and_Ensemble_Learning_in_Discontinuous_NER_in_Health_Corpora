By discharge, patient was extubated, alert, moving all four extremiteis well, speaking occasional words, following commands

Pertinent Results:
EKG [**2019-01-11**] OSH: RBBB, tachcardia, LAD, ST changes opposite major deflection.

EKG [**2019-01-12**]: Sinus tachy, RBBB, nml axis

Radiology:
Head CT OSH [**2019-01-11**]: Acute to subacute infarct L temporal lobe with interval development of parenchymal hemorrhage.

Head CT [**2019-01-12**]: Large left MCA ?fusiform? aneurysm without definite evidence of rupture. Large left MCA territory subacute infarction. 
Overread:  Agree. MRI/MRA has been recommended to confirm that the lesion is aneurysm and not other pathology such as mass or unusual bleed CTA may also be helpful.

CXR at OSH [**2019-01-11**]: Bilobar PNA

CXR [**2019-01-12**]: Bilateral lower lobe opacities, R>L (right middle and lower, left lower), with vascular redistribution, deep sulcus sign and hyperlucency in RUL 

CT HEAD [**2019-01-17**]: 
1.  No significant change in the appearance of the left MCA territory subacute infarction with an 18 x 11 mm hyperdense focus medially within the temporal lobe consistent with hemorrhagic infarction. 
2.  No evidence for midline shift or herniation. 

EEG [**2019-01-18**]: 
This is an abnormal EEG due to the frequent spike and wave discharges, primarily from the left frontal region with spread to the  left and right hemispheres independently. These discharges suggest a  left frontal region of cortical irritability. The second abnormality  suggests diffuse encephalopathy, which may be seen with infections, 
toxic metabolic abnormalities, medications and ischemia. 

MRI/MRA [**2019-01-18**]:
1.  There are confluent areas of abnormal signal consistent with the history of herpes encephalitis.  There is involvement of the medial and lateral aspect of the left temporal lobe, the left gyrus rectus, the left hippocampus, and both cingulate gyri. 2.  There is a stable nearly 2 cm hemorrhage at the anteromedial aspect of left temporal lobe near the MCA and there is a stable small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage. 
3. There is good flow in the distal internal carotid arteries, the distal vertebral arteries, and the basilar artery.  There is mild distal asymmetry of the PCAs, which is commonly seen.  There is probably slight elevation of the left MCA by the hemorrhage but no stenosis of it is seen. IMPRESSION:  There is no significant stenosis of the left MCA from the adjacent hemorrhage. 

CXR [**2019-01-27**]: Worsening left lower two foci of consolidation which might represent worsening infection or aspiration, with otherwise unchanged appearance of the lungs. 

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**lastname 4829**] is an 82 year old male who was transferred from an outside hospital for hypoxic respiratory failure.

# Pneumonia and sepsis: the patient likely experienced an aspiration event resulting in either aspiration pneumonia or chemical pneumonitis and hypoxia. Upon transfer, the patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 16**] [**Hospital Unit Name 154**]. A CXR showed evidence of CHF (iatrogenic due to fluid resuscitation) and possible PNA.  An EKG showed RBBB and no concordant ST changes.  Cardiac enzymes were negative for MI. He was intubated on the day of admission and started on Vancomycin and Zosyn. Mr. [**lastname 4829**] qualified for the sepsis protocol and was treated as such with mixed venous O2 monitoring, maintaining MAP > 65 (pressors), CVP 10-12 (fluids), following UOP and high-dose steroids.

His [**Hospital Unit Name 154**] course was complicated by development of pansensitive Klebsiella pneumonia that was treated with 
Meropenem/Vancomycin/Flagyl. The patient's family decided that they wanted the patient to be extubated despite RISB > 100. He was subsequently transferred to the floor and oxygen requirement weaned. The patient is being converted to oral antibiotic coverage upon discharge with levofloxacin and will require 2 more days of treatment.

# Altered mental status: the patient had a recent history of hemorrhagic stroke and HSV encephalitis. The patient was continued on Acyclovir for HSV encephalitis for 21 day course total.  The patient's SBPs were maintained between 100-140 in setting of possible intracranial bleed.  Aspirin was held.  An MRI was performed which showed similar findings to the previous MRI.  Neuro recommended an additional month of Dilantin after discharge and after a repeat EEG.

# Seizure history: the patient had a known history of seizures during his last hospital admission, and he was maintained on dilantin.  His target therapeutic range is 15-20 as per 
Neurology recommendations. The patient showed no evidence of seizure activity during this hospitalization.

# Thrombocytosis: the patient's platelet count reached 1100 during this admission and it was thought to be related to an acute inflammatory reaction. ESR, CRP, ferritin, fibrinogen were also significantly elevated. The patient's platelet count was decreasing at the time of discharge.

# Hyperglycemia: the patient developed elevated blood sugars in the setting of high dose steroid administration. Although, high dose steroids were stopped, he continued to have some isolated elevations. The patient's blood sugars should be monitored and covered with sliding scale insulin until further work-up or resolution.

# Sacral decubitus ulcer: the patient was noted to have a Stage II sacral decubitus ulcer during this hospitalization. It did not appear to be infected. Wound care was consulted. It was treated with duoderm dressing, air mattress, frequent position changes and physical therapy.

# Osteomyelitis: the patient has a chronically infected hip for approximately 40 years, per his family.  This was unlikely to be the predominant infectious source given it's appearance on this admission. Wound care was consulted to provide recommendations. 

# Nutrition: Given the patient's altered mental status and concern for aspiration, a speech and swallow examination was performed. The patient was cleared for nectar thick liquids and regular solids.
