CXR: No radiographic evidence of pneumonia. 

CT head: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
74F with mixed dementia, presenting with a one week history of mental status changes / increased confusion, also with hypertensive urgency.  

On the floor, the Pt. was treated with hydralazine PRN for elevated systolic pressure, and was transitioned back to amlodipine and losartan, with goal SBP 140-150.  Metoprolol was discontinued.  Pt. was normotensive at the time of discharge.

Pt's change in mental status thought to be multifactorial: ddx included worsening dementia with possible contribution of hypertensive encephalopathy and hypercalcemia.  With continued orientation and support from family members and nursing staff, Pt.'s mentation improved.  Her donepezil was continued.  

Per records, Pt. has chronic hypercalcemia thought to be related to her chronic renal insufficiency/failure and secondary hyperparathyroidism.  Tums and Vit. D were held.  Sevelamer was continued for hyperphosphatemia at an increased dose (2400mg TID), and the Pt. was started on sensipar 30mg QD.

The Pt. was seen and evaluated by social work. It is probable that Pt. will require increased amounts of support at home over the coming months/years in performing her ADLs.

The Pt. will continue hemodialysis on M,W,F.

An SPEP was checked just before discharge, at the request of the renal team.  The result can be followed up at the Pt's next appointment.
