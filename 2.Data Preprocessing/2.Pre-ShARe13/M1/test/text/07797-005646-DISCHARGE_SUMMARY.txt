Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**lastname 2892**] was admitted to the ICU with Q1 hour neurochecks, started on Mannitol for extreme edema.  She was also started on Dilantin for seizure prophlaxis.   She underwent resection early am of 7/14 for diagnosis and prevention of uncal herniation.   Preliminary biopsy was consistent with b-cell lymphoma. The case went without complication the posteromedial resection, it was quite difficult to distinguish between brain and tumor, and it was believed that some small residual amount of tumor was left behind.

Post operatively she returned to the ICU was awake, alert and orientated X3.  Her speech was improving slowly she was neurologically intact.  Her BP was kept less than 120 overnight. Mannitol was not restarted post operatively.  Her decadron was weaned down slowly.

On POD#2 she was tolerating a regular diet, voiding without difficulty.  She was transferred out of the unit to the regular floor on post operative day 3.  She was seen by physical therapy and felt safe to go home with speech therapy. Occupational therapy also felt she was safe to go home.
