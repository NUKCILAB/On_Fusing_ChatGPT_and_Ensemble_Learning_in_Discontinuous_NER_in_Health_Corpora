FINAL REPORT
INDICATION:  Severe respiratory failure status post trach and PEG.  Assess for trach placement.

COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from 14 hours prior.

SINGLE AP SEMI-UPRIGHT BEDSIDE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There has been interval placement of a tracheostomy tube with tip approximately 5.6 cm above the carina.  Right subclavian line terminates at the mid SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.  There has been slight decrease to small bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema with some residual cephalization and perivascular haziness.  Retrocardiac opacity with clustered bronchial markings is likely due to atelectasis.

IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of tracheostomy tube, in satisfactory position.  Mild improvement in CHF.  Left basilar atelectasis persists.
