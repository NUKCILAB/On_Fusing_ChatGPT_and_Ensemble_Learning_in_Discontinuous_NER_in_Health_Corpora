CXR [**12-14**] 
Median sternotomy and aortic valve prosthesis is identified and unchanged. There is again seen a left apical pneumothorax which is small and unchanged since the previous study. There is a small amount of free air underneath the right hemidiaphragm. No focal consolidation, signs of pulmonary edema, or pleural effusions are noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent left apical pneumothorax and free air underneath the hemidiaphragm not significantly changed.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also stable.

[**12-11**] TEE
Conclusions:  
Pre-CPB: No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are   simple atheroma in the aortic root. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.   There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. The descending thoracic   aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic   aorta. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is   moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.19cm2) Mild to moderate ([**01-07**]+)   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. The   inter-ventricular septum is hypertrophied near the LVOT, but does not cause  
obstruction or a gradient.  
Post-CPB: Preserved biventricular systolic fxn. A prosthetic aortic valve is   seen with good leaflet excursion, trace regurgitation and a residual peak   gradient of 19 mmHg. Ascending and descending aorta intact. A small septal   myotomy has been done at the LVOT. Other parameters as pre-bypass.  

Brief Hospital Course:
70 year old male admitted for workup of angina which cardiac catherization revealed LM and LAD disease with Aortic stenosis.  Underwent cardiac surgery pre operative work up and was transfered to the operating room on [**12-11**] and underwent coronary artery bypass graft, aortic valve replacement, and septal myomectomy.  Please see operative report for further details.  He was transferred to cardiac surgery recovery unit for continued hemodynamic monitoring on neosynephrine and propofol.  With in the first 24 hours he awoke neurologically intact, extubated without difficulty, and weaned from vasoactive medications.  He continued to progress, was started on beta blockers and on post operative day 2 he was transferred to [**Wardname **] 2.  He continued to progress and worked with physical therapy.  On post operative day 4 he was ready for discharge home with VNA services.
