HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**lastname 1488**] is a 74-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure and ICD implantation who was brought by his family to the [**Hospital 1489**] Emergency Department for evaluation of change in mental status.  Routine laboratories were sent in the
Emergency Department and the patient was found to have a chest x-ray consistent with a right middle lobe pneumonia. He was also febrile in the Emergency Room.   His mental status improved with Tylenol and defervescence and Levaquin was started.  The patient's family stated that he had had a gradual weight loss of approximately 42 pounds over the last two months with decreased oral intake and failure to thrive at home.  His initial oxygen saturation was 87% on four liters nasal cannula, however, this improved to 96% on a nonrebreather.  As the Emergency Department laboratories were returned, the patient was noted to have an elevated digoxin level at 3.0 and elevated CPK at 209 with a negative index.
Patient also became intermittently hypotensive in the
Emergency Department and a Coronary Care Unit consult for unit admission was requested.  Patient denied fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath or abdominal pain.

[**2009-11-27**] indicating 70% left anterior descending stenosis, 100% right coronary artery stenosis and a 50% D1 stenosis with an ejection fraction of 15-20%. 2.  Congestive heart failure. 3.  Status post ICD implantation. 4.  Tricuspid regurgitation. 5.  History of cerebral vascular accident. 6.  Seizure disorder. 7.  Hypothyroidism. 8.  Gout. 9.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy. 10.

Levoxyl 0.125 mg po q.d., Flomax 0.4 mg po q.h.s., zaroxolyn 2.5 mg po q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] denies alcohol use and has a remote history of tobacco use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 100.4.  Heart rate 70.
Blood pressure 88/48.  Respiratory rate 20.  Oxygen saturation 97% on a 100% nonrebreather.  In general, this is a tremulous elderly gentlemen lying alert in bed in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat exam indicated normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles were intact.  Oral mucosa was moist.  Neck exam indicated a jugular venous pressure of 10 cm.  There was no thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.  Pulmonary exam:  The patient had decreased breath sounds at the base of the right lung field and scattered bibasilar rales.  There were no wheezes or rhonchi.  Cardiovascular exam indicated regular rhythm, normal S1, S2, prominent S4.  Point of maximal impulse was at the mid axillary line.  There were no murmurs.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with normal bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Patient had 1+ peripheral pulses bilaterally with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema. Neurological exam indicated that the patient was alert and oriented times three, although slow to respond.  The rest of his neurologic exam was nonfocal.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  White blood cell count of 9.0 with 85% neutrophils, 0 bands, 3 monocytes and 5 eosinophils.
Hematocrit was 44.8 with a platelet count of 130,000.  Chem-7 was remarkable for a BUN of 104, creatinine of 2.6.  CK was 209 with an MB of 11 and an index of 5.3.  Digoxin level was 3.0.  Phenobarbital level was 20.4.  Urinalysis was negative. Chest x-ray indicated the presence of an infiltrate in the right middle lobe as well as cardiomegaly.  There were no obvious signs of congestive heart failure.  Electrocardiogram indicated a paced rhythm at 70 beats per minute with a wide QRS complex and no ST or T wave changes.  There were no changes compared to a prior electrocardiogram.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit for rule out of myocardial infarction and treatment of pneumonia with possible sepsis.  He received gentle intravenous hydration overnight and ruled out by cardiac enzymes.  His creatinine returned to baseline levels with hydration.  His antihypertensive medications were initially held secondary to his hypotension, however, as the patient improved hemodynamically, each of his antihypertensive medications were added back.  Digoxin was held during his hospital stay due to a supratherapeutic level.  He was continued on a ten day course of renal dosed levofloxacin for community acquired pneumonia.  By hospital day number two, the patient's mental status had improved to baseline.  His oxygen requirement had diminished and as he was hemodynamically stable, he was transferred to the floor where he was successfully weaned off of oxygen.  He was seen by Physical Therapy and cleared for safe discharge to home with the recommendation of a home safety evaluation.  He was to follow-up with his primary care physician in one week for a repeat digoxin level.
