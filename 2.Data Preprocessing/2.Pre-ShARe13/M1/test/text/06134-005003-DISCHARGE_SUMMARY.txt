History of Present Illness:
64 y/o male with h/o CAD (s/p 5VCABG 1996), HTN, and hyperlipidemia who presented with acute onset of CP. Patient states that recently he has noticed increasing exertional CP (chest pressure) over the past year. Today, around 1pm, he developed non-exertional [**10-01**] SSCP associated with SOB and diaphoresis.  Pt was taken to OSH. EKG showed STE in V2, V3, aVf and STD in V1, aVL. Pt was [**Hospital Unit Name 23**]-flighted to [**Hospital1 2**] for cath.

In the cath lab, he was found to have occluded SVG to D1 and RCA; patent LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM1; severe 3VD. 90% stenosed RCA was stented with 2 overlapping drug eluting stents. Mildly elevated R and L sided pressure. Normal CO/CI.

The patient was transferred to the CCU post-cath for further monitoring and managment. In the CCU, pt was asymptomatic without any CP, SOB, diaphoresis, nausea, or pain.

Cardiac cath ([**2013-07-20**]): Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed severe three vessel native coronary artery disease.  The left main coronary artery had diffuse disease up to 30%.  The left anterior descending coronary artery was totally occluded in the mid vessel after the take off of a moderate sized D1 vessel.  The left circumflex coronary artery was totally occluded proximally.  The right coronary artery had a 90% ulcerated proximal stenosis, with diffuse 40-50% 
stenoses in the mid and distal RCA.  The RCA was a large vessel with a  PDA and 2 PL branches. Vein graft angiography revealed a patent SVG to OM1.  The SVG --> D1 and SVG --> RCA (with possible jump graft previously) were totally occluded. Arterial conduit angiography revealed patent LIMA --> LAD. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided filling pressures, with RVEDP = 13 mmhg and mean PCW = 20 mmhg.  There was no evidence of pulmonary hypertension.  The cardiac output and index  were preserved at 5.5 and 3.0 respectively.  There was no evidence of  systemic hypertension. Left ventriculography was not undertaken. 

Echocardiogram ([**2013-07-22**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and  cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic  dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal half of the inferior wall and mid-inferior septum. The remaining left ventricular segments contract normally and overall systolic function is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. 
EF 55%

Brief Hospital Course:
64 y/o male with h/o CAD s/p 5V CABG in [**2002**], HTN, and hyperlipidemia who presented with an inferior STEMI. The following issues were addressed during this hospitalization.

1. Cardiac
- Ischemia
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 2**] for catheterization after he was found to have had an inferior STEMI. See above for EKG results. He is s/p RCA [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] x2. He was transferred to the CCU for post-cath management. The patient was hypotensive on night of admission but was mentating well and had good urine output. He did not require pressors. He was started on aspirin 325 mg PO daily, clopidogrel 75 mg PO daily, and atorvastatin 80 mg PO daily. His HbA1C was checked and was 6.8. The patient will need further workup as an outpatient with his PCP regarding possible glucose intolerance. His BGs during this hospital admission were borderline. He had no h/o DM upon admission but may have had impaired glucose tolerance for some time prior to admission. The patient was transferred to the floor from the CCU as his clinical status improved. PT evaluated the patient and cleared him to return to home. He will need outpatient cardiac rehab coordinated by his PCP after discharge. The patient was instructed about his new medications and the importance of taking Plavix due to the placement of 2 stents. His medications will need to be managed by his PCP and follow up visit with cardiology.

- Pump
The patient was thought to be volume overloaded given elevated L sided pressures with wedge of 20 in cath lab. He was given IV lasix x 1 but required volume afterward. An echocardiogram was done after his catheterization and the results are above. He will need a repeat echo in approximately 6 months to re-evaluate his EF and any changes in his cardiac function.

2. HTN
The patient was initially hypotensive but that resolved and he remained normotensive for the remainder of the hospital course. He was on atenolol 25 mg PO daily at home. He was changed to metoprolol BID in house in order to titrate. He was discharged home on his home dose of atenolol.

3. Hyperlipidemia
The patient was on atorvastatin 40 mg PO qd at home. Increased to 80 mg PO daily for ACS. He was also discharged home on atorvastatin 80 mg PO daily.
