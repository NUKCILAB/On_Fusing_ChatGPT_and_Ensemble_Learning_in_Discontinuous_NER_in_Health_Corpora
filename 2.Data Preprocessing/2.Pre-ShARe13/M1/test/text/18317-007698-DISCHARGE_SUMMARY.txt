The ventilator was withdrawn and the patient expired shortly after.

Time of death was recorded as 8:56 p.m. on [**2015-03-30**].

Medical examiner was notified and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2111**] of the medical examiner's office declined the case, however autopsy permission was granted by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**lastname 2112**] and autopsy was to be performed expeditiously as there were still no clear etiology as per the asystolic event that lead to an anoxic brain injury and eventual brain death and demise in this patient.

On the night of [**2015-03-30**], I declared the patient after withdrawal of support.
