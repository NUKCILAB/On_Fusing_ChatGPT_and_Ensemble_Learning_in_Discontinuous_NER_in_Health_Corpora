Initial labs at [**Hospital 288**] showed white count of 16.3, hematocrit 47.6, platelets 307.  Differential showed 92% polys, 5.3% lymphs, 1.9% monos.

0.3.  Tox screen positive for cocaine and benzos, however, the patient had received Ativan at Wood [**Hospital 428**] Hospital. LFTs and amylase were unremarkable.  UA showed 15 ketones, no cells, few bacteria, 3 epithelials.  EKG at [**Last Name (un) 1131**] showed normal sinus rhythm at 80, normal intervals, axis 70, T wave inversions in 3 and aVF, T flattening 2.  At [**Hospital 57**] 3 1/2 hours later EKG showed sinus tach at 120, normal intervals, [**Street Address 726**] depressions in 2, 3 and aVF, T wave inversions in 3 and aVF, no prior study from this hospital available for comparison.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 74**] from Wood [**Hospital 428**] Hospital where his respiratory status continued to improve.  He was extubated without difficulty on 11:15 a.m. on the 26th and the patient was called out to the floor.  Given his elevated CK on arrival, it was followed during this admission.  CKMB and troponin on arrival were 603, 3, less than 0.3.  CK trended down from 603, 429, 325, 280 at 6:00 a.m. on the 27th.  MB fraction remained at 1.
Thus the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction.

Given this patient's history of anabolic steroid abuse, insulin abuse for weight lifting purposes as well as indiscretion with recreational drugs, several conversations were held with the patient about decision making in terms of use of recreational substances and the potential dangers in the use of cocaine and gamma-hydroxybutyrate as well as an attempt to communicate to the patient that he was lucky to have come out of this incident without further deterioration. He was recommended to follow up with a substance abuse counselor, given two numbers for both Tri-City substance abuse facility in [**Location (un) 1132**] close to his home in [**Location (un) 1133**] as well as given the name of [**Doctor First Name 1134**] McLean at [**Hospital 1135**] clinic.
