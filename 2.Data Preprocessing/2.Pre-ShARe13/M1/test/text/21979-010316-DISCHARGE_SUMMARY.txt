Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**lastname 2290**] was initially kept strictly NPO due to his suspected aspiration pneumonia.  He was treated with vancomycin and Zosyn for empiric coverage.  He was given supplemental oxygen via a face tent with standing nebulizer treatments.  In spite of his NPO status, he was having frequent episodes of intermittent hypoxia requiring suctioning of thick, tenacious secretions.  This, in addition to serial CXRs revealed that he was clearly aspirating his secretions on a continuous basis in spite of his NPO status.  Due to this as well as his baseline dementia, it was thought that putting in a PEG tube for nutrition would not solve the problem of aspiration since he was clearly unable to manage his own secretions.  Furthermore, it was clear that he would need constant restraints to avoid traumatic removal of a PEG, which was thought to be an unacceptable impairment in his quality of life.  In the setting of all of these issues and his severe, acute, worsening aspiration pneumonia, he was made comfort-measures-only by his family and legal guardian; he was put on a morphine drip to help with his obvious discomfort, and he expired shortly thereafter.
